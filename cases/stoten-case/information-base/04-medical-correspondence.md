## 4. WhatsApp Messages - Steroid Incident (Cape Town)
**Source:** Dr. James Laporta's phone

### Patient Complaint (Louise Stoten):
> "Did we give me more steroids with chemo today. Wide awake with splitting headache at 4am?"
>
> "I think in light of the issues last week I should have been made aware of this and they clearly should not have been given without my knowledge or at 3pm. I have been up all night and feel very stressed and unwell. I am not prepared to have any more steroids can we find an alternative. I have not been given steroids with chemo at other clinics and clearly for good reason. This has really shaken my trust and we will need to discuss on Wednesday as I need to feel safe to heal. I did not feel safe with the care at the London clinic which is why I came back to Cape Town, but am now equally concerned."

### Dr. Laporta's Response:
Acknowledged the communication breakdown and provided clarification:

1. **Steroids are standard with chemotherapy** - "You have always had steroids with chemo"
2. **Dose given was LOW** - Only 2mg (standard is 12mg) - essential to avoid transfusion reactions as it was first Eribulin dose
3. **Effect was exacerbated** by shortness of breath and anxiety
4. **Previous Betanoid dosage was higher** with Paclitaxel
5. **Acknowledged communication issue** - "D1 prednisone script could have been explained better from London"
6. **Affirmed commitment** - "A very complex case, that is at the top of our list"

### Dr. Laporta's Commitment:
> "Let's lean into this tension point and work through it together so that not only protocol, but relationship and healing space can be par excellent."

## 6. Dr. James Laporta - Voice Note (February 2, 2026)
**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Source:** Voice note transcription from Dr Laporta
**Purpose:** Suggested response to Paul Stoten's complaint

### Suggested Response Approach:
Dr Laporta recommends a short email response expressing sympathy and summarizing the clinical timeline.

### Key Clinical Points (Dr Laporta's recollection):

**Initial Presentation:**
> "When we first saw her...she was incredibly frail and pre-terminal."

**Initial Treatment Success:**
> "Fortunately the medication worked and her tumour markers dropped, she was able to travel and spend quality time in Europe on hormonal blockers."

**Progression & Malta:**
- When progression appeared, she had an X-ray in Malta
- Decided to go to London for treatment

**London Events:**
- Referred to Prof Stebbing for treatment
- **Offered oncology treatment in London which she declined**
- Wished to come to Cape Town for further treatment

**Pre-Flight (London to Cape Town):**
- Had significant cough although was stable
- **Advised to go to nearest EC emergency centre facility**
- **Patient preferred to take oral antibiotics instead**
- Some steroids were given

**Steroid Defense:**
> "The steroids were certainly not overdosed and the side effect of agitation is well-known."

**Cape Town & Death:**
> "Luckily she arrived safely in Cape Town and despite our best efforts there was progression or lower respiratory tract infection which worsened and she passed away in hospital under the care of Dr. De Andrade."

**Offer to Discuss:**
> "If you would like to sit down and discuss in detail some of the aspects, I'd be happy to do that."

### Medicolegal Significance:
- Confirms patient autonomy: declined London oncology, chose Cape Town
- Confirms patient declined EC advice, preferred oral antibiotics
- Supports steroid defense (not overdose, known side effect)
- Shows willingness to engage constructively
