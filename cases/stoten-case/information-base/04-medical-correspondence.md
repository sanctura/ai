## 4. WhatsApp Messages - Steroid Incident (Cape Town)
**Source:** Dr. James Laporta's phone

### Patient Complaint (Louise Stoten):
> "Did we give me more steroids with chemo today. Wide awake with splitting headache at 4am?"
>
> "I think in light of the issues last week I should have been made aware of this and they clearly should not have been given without my knowledge or at 3pm. I have been up all night and feel very stressed and unwell. I am not prepared to have any more steroids can we find an alternative. I have not been given steroids with chemo at other clinics and clearly for good reason. This has really shaken my trust and we will need to discuss on Wednesday as I need to feel safe to heal. I did not feel safe with the care at the London clinic which is why I came back to Cape Town, but am now equally concerned."

### Dr. Laporta's Response:
Acknowledged the communication breakdown and provided clarification:

1. **Steroids are standard with chemotherapy** - "You have always had steroids with chemo"
2. **Dose given was LOW** - Only 2mg (standard is 12mg) - essential to avoid transfusion reactions as it was first Eribulin dose
3. **Effect was exacerbated** by shortness of breath and anxiety
4. **Previous Betanoid dosage was higher** with Paclitaxel
5. **Acknowledged communication issue** - "D1 prednisone script could have been explained better from London"
6. **Affirmed commitment** - "A very complex case, that is at the top of our list"

### Dr. Laporta's Commitment:
> "Let's lean into this tension point and work through it together so that not only protocol, but relationship and healing space can be par excellent."

## 5. CEO Notes on Case (February 1, 2026)
**Source:** Internal memo after receiving Paul Stoten's complaint

### Key Points:
- Patient "left our clinic fairly stable but requiring ongoing oxygen"
- Admitted to Dr. Roger de Andrade on Sept 15
- "Worsening respiratory symptoms at Cape Gate; either infection or tumor"
- "Died in hospital 16th"
- Assessment: "Very well managed"

### Questions to Verify:
1. CQC license dates for London
2. Prescription written by nurse Maria (not Sanctura)
3. Whether any "overdose" occurred (CEO position: no overdose was given)

### CEO's Assessment of Complaint:
> "This is possibly a reflex from their inheritance discrepancies post"
>
> "This is not about negligence - it is a shark tank for money"
