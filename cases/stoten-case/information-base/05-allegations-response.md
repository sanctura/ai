# Allegations vs. Clinic Response

## Overview
Paul Stoten sent a threatening message around February 1, 2026, making several allegations against Sanctura. This document compares each allegation with the clinic's documented position.

---

## Allegation 1: Operating Without License

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "It has come to our attention that you operated in London without a licence in July August. My lawyers want to involve the police. This would mean closure and arrest."
>
> "I see got a licence for treatment in September over 30 days late of when Louise was operated on."

### Clinic Position:
- **Status:** STRONG DEFENSE (per Medicolegal Documents)
- CEO note: "We did have a licence July / August?- need to check"

### Medicolegal Defense (Feb 2026):
Dr Laporta's UK Defensive Executive Summary clarifies:
> "Dr James Laporta did not practise as a medical doctor in the United Kingdom in relation to Ms Louise Stoten. While in the UK, his role was explicitly limited to that of a **naturopath / integrative oncology support practitioner**, operating outside GMC registration and without holding himself out as a UK-licensed medical practitioner."

Key points:
- UK interventions were **supportive and adjunctive only** (IV nutrition, photobiomodulation, hyperthermia)
- These do NOT constitute practice of medicine under UK law when delivered without diagnostic/prescribing authority
- All oncological decisions made by GMC-registered Prof. Justin Stebbing
- All prescribing done by registered Nurse Practitioner Maria Tam

> "There is no basis for GMC jurisdiction or allegations of unsafe practice."

### CQC Registration Status:
- **CQC Registration Date:** 22 September 2025
- **Treatment Period:** July-August 2025
- **Implication:** Clinic was not CQC registered during Louise Stoten's London treatment

### Why This Doesn't Undermine Defense:
- Primary defense does not rely on CQC status
- Dr Laporta's naturopathic activities (IV nutrition, photobiomodulation, hyperthermia) may not require CQC registration
- All medical prescribing was done by registered NP Maria Tam, not Dr Laporta
- The defense rests on role delineation, not facility registration

## Allegation 2: Overdose in London Causing Sleep Deprivation

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "I need to be assured that Louise's overdose in London will not re-occur... Results were no sleep for Louise for 28 hours and massive trauma and loss of trust in the London clinic."
>
> "The prescription was incomplete, the chemist was also negligent in giving such drugs with a vague incomplete prescription and directions for use as no dose was written down on this prescription of sorts."

### Clinic Position:
- CEO: "prescription steroids before flight - endocrine nurse Maria - not us"
- The steroid prescription was written by endocrine nurse Maria, NOT by Sanctura
- CEO indicates: "no overdose was given, certainly no medicines that would have effected her outcome"

### Medicolegal Defense (Feb 2026):

**Clinical Rationale for Steroids:**
> "Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed for worsening respiratory symptoms in the context of advanced metastatic breast cancer, where differential diagnoses included lymphangitis carcinomatosis and/or lower respiratory tract infection. In such settings, corticosteroids are **standard supportive therapy** used to reduce inflammatory pulmonary oedema and palliate dyspnoea."

**Patient's Pre-existing Factors:**
- Documented anxious predisposition
- Advanced malignancy causing distress
- Breathlessness
- Imminent international travel (additional stress)

**On "Overdose" Claim:**
> "While steroid-related agitation and insomnia were acknowledged and reassurance was provided, **these effects do not constitute evidence of overdose**. From a South African oncology practice context, such cumulative dosing would fall within accepted therapeutic safety limits."

**Prescribing Authority:**
> "All prescribing in the UK was undertaken by a registered Nurse Practitioner [Sister Maria Tam]. Dr Laporta did not prescribe, control dosing, or override prescribing authority."

**Dr Laporta's Observation:**
> "She continuously complained about steroids."
- Patient had ongoing sensitivity/intolerance to steroids generally (not unique to one incident)

### Invoice Evidence (London):
- **INV-0243 (Aug 4, 2025):** Prednisolone 5mg at £15.95 (low dose - typical doses are 20-60mg)

### Action Required:
- **CRITICAL:** Obtain antibiotic prescription records from Sister Maria Tam
- Confirm exact steroid dose from Maria Tam's records

## Allegation 3: Repeated Overdose in Cape Town

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "In Capetown Louise was again given a overdose almost on arrival. And not really interviewed as to why she was so messed up physically and emotionally. This overdose happened again to a tired and confused Louise and would in the same manner stop her sleeping and effect her physical mental and chances for her survival."
>
> "So 2 OVERDOSES - First an infusion then a prescription of similar compounds REPEATED in Capetown."

### Clinic Position:
- CEO: "no overdose was given"
- WhatsApp messages show Dr. Laporta gave a **LOW dose** (2mg vs standard 12mg)
- Steroids are standard protocol with chemotherapy to prevent transfusion reactions
- Dr. Laporta acknowledged communication could have been better

### Supporting Evidence (WhatsApp from Dr. Laporta):
> "You have always had steroids with chemo. The dosage is usually 12mg, I had given you 2mg yesterday. This is essential to avoid any transfusion reactions as it was your first eribulin dose."

### Clinical Context:
- Sleep disturbance was "likely exacerbated by sense of SOB [shortness of breath] and some anxiety"
- Patient had advanced metastatic cancer with respiratory compromise

---

## Allegation 4: Chemotherapy Given When Patient Too Weak

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "Then she was given chemotherapy even though she was not strong enough to handle this..."

### Clinic Position:
- Treatment was given according to established protocol
- Eribulin was given at **50% of standard dosage** (0.7mg/m2 vs 1.4mg/m2)
- Patient received prophylactic Neupogen support for blood counts
- Received Nplate for platelet support
- Per Prof. Stebbing's letter, Eribulin was a recommended systemic option

### Supporting Evidence:
- Treatment protocol specifically noted: "This is 50% of the dosage"
- Multiple supportive treatments were administered (blood cell support, nutrition, etc.)
- Referral letter shows careful monitoring: concern about neutropenia and CRP levels

---

## Allegation 5: Poor Communication About Medications

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "Not being made aware of what she was taking and not told to wait as her injections would last 2 days."

### Clinic Position:
- Dr. Laporta acknowledged in WhatsApp: "D1 prednisone script could have been explained better from London"
- Committed to upgrading communication

### Supporting Evidence (Dr. Laporta's response):
> "Feeling safe, and feeling that you have full sight of all meds within treatment protocol is essential to healing and autonomy."
>
> "Let's upgrade comms..."

---

## Allegation 6: Premature Death Caused by Clinic

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "I've lost Louise. LOUISE HAS LOST HER LIFE PREMATURELY. LOUISES could have lived a year. Maybe more, but not with this level of mistakes and oversight."

### Clinic Position:
- CEO: Patient "died from Covid or PE or PCP or progression - all lung related"
- Prof. Stebbing's letter (July 10, 2025) stated prognosis was "<12 months"
- Patient had extensively pre-treated Stage IV metastatic breast cancer
- Final referral letter documented severe decline: hypoxic pneumonia, volatile inflammatory markers, possible PCP

### Supporting Evidence:
- Prof. Stebbing's prognosis letter (July 10, 2025)
- Referral letter to Dr. de Andrade showing clinical deterioration
- CEO note: "she died in hospital Cape Gate when she got too [un]well"

---

## Allegation 7: Financial Demands

### Paul Stoten's Claim:
> "I had to sell our house as financially we broke down... So far £500,000 it has cost. And with all the sadness and stress I'm sure the courts would allow 10x this for just operations in an unlicensed clinic without the overdose and prescription harm."
>
> "I leave it to you for 7 days to decide what you would like to do to change processes and make this all right. I am not negotiating on this settlement or the terms or process improvements."

### Clinic Position:
- CEO: "This is not about negligence - it is a shark tank for money"
- CEO: "This is possibly a reflex from their inheritance discrepancies post"
- "Almost certain their complaint comes from the invoices"

## Summary Table (Updated Feb 2026)

| Allegation | Clinic Defense | Evidence Strength |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| No CQC license | Dr Laporta acted as naturopath, not doctor; no GMC jurisdiction | **STRONG** |
| London overdose | Recognized adverse effects, not overdose; within safety limits; prescribed by NP Maria Tam | **STRONG** |
| Cape Town overdose | 2mg given (vs 12mg standard) - LOW dose | **STRONG** |
| Chemo when too weak | 50% dose, full supportive care | **STRONG** |
| Poor communication | Acknowledged, committed to improve | Acknowledged |
| Caused premature death | 43-day gap; terminal trajectory evident; hospital care at death | **STRONG** |

## Dr Laporta's Assessment (Feb 2026)

> "We have everything we need, only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill."

> "The referral is sound - see dates 15th/16th Sep when passed away."

## London Invoice Evidence Summary

The 8 London invoices (July 11 - Aug 4, 2025) show:
- Total billed: £4,414.25
- **Aug 4, 2025 (INV-0243):** Last London visit included Prednisolone 5mg + Hyperthermia 90min
- Patient received IV infusions, blood tests, and consultations in London
- Antibiotic (Ceftriaxone) administered July 15 - infection concerns predated Cape Town
- Gap of 4 days between last London invoice (Aug 4) and first Cape Town invoice (Aug 8)

## Paul Stoten's Involvement

Dr Laporta noted: **"Paul was nowhere."**

This suggests husband was not present during treatment period, raising questions about the factual basis for his detailed allegations.
