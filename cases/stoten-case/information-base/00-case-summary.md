# Louise Stoten Case - Executive Summary

## Case Overview
A deceased patient's husband (Paul Stoten) has sent a threatening letter alleging negligence by Sanctura clinic in the treatment of his wife Louise Stoten, who passed away on **September 16, 2025** from Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer.

## Current Status: DEFENSE POSITION STRONG
- **Threat received:** ~February 1, 2026
- **Deadline:** 7 days from receipt to respond
- **Threat level:** Legal action threatened including police involvement, clinic closure claims
- **Financial claim:** Paul Stoten claims £500,000+ in losses
- **Dr Laporta's Assessment (Feb 2026):** "We have everything we need, only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill"

## Defense Summary

### UK Practice Defense (Critical)
Dr Laporta did **NOT** practice as a medical doctor in the UK. His role was explicitly limited to:
- Naturopath / Integrative Oncology Support Practitioner
- Operating OUTSIDE GMC registration
- Supportive care only (IV nutrition, photobiomodulation, hyperthermia)

**All UK prescribing** (steroids, antibiotics) was done by **Sister Maria Tam** (Registered Nurse Practitioner)

### Key Defense Points
| Allegation | Defense | Strength |
|------------|---------|----------|
| No CQC license | Dr Laporta acted as naturopath, not doctor | **STRONG** |
| Steroid overdose | Recognized adverse effects, not overdose; within safety limits | **STRONG** |
| Prescribing issues | All prescribing by registered NP Maria Tam | **STRONG** |
| Caused death | 43-day gap; terminal trajectory evident; hospital care at death | **STRONG** |

### Causation Defense
> "Ms Stoten's deterioration and death occurred weeks later in South Africa under hospital-based physician care. There is no temporal, clinical, or causal linkage between Dr Laporta's UK role and the terminal outcome."

## Key Parties
| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| Louise Stoten | Deceased patient (DOB: 08/04/1969, Died: 16/09/2025) |
| Paul Stoten | Husband/Complainant - **"was nowhere" during treatment (per Dr Laporta)** |
| Dr James Laporta | Director of Sanctura; Naturopath (UK) / Treating Physician (SA) |
| **Sister Maria Tam** | **Registered Nurse Practitioner - ALL UK prescribing** |
| Prof Justin Stebbing | GMC-Registered Oncologist (UK medical authority) |
| Dr Roger de Andrade | Receiving physician at Cape Gate Hospital (final care) |

## Outstanding Critical Item

**Sister Maria Tam's prescription records** - antibiotics and steroids
> "only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill"

## Financial Summary (Total Billing)
| Location | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| London (8 invoices) | £4,414.25 |
| Cape Town (35 invoices) | R 122,816.99 (~£5,340) |
| **Total** | **~£9,754** |

## Key Allegations from Paul Stoten

2. Medication overdose causing 28+ hours sleep deprivation (London)
3. Repeated overdose in Cape Town
4. Chemotherapy given when patient was too weak
5. Poor communication about medications

## Motive Assessment
- CEO: "This is possibly a reflex from their inheritance discrepancies post"
- CEO: "Almost certain their complaint comes from the invoices"
- CEO: "This is not about negligence - it is a shark tank for money"
- Dr Laporta: "This may be an inheritance issue"
- Dr Laporta: "Paul was nowhere" (not present during treatment)

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **CRITICAL:** Obtain prescription records from Sister Maria Tam
2. Engage senior legal counsel (through Yes to Life)
