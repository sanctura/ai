## Key Defense Position: UK Practice

### Dr Laporta's Role in UK (Critical Distinction)

Dr James Laporta **did NOT practice as a medical doctor** in the United Kingdom in relation to Ms Louise Stoten.

| Aspect | Dr Laporta's UK Role |
|--------|---------------------|
| Professional Status | Naturopath / Integrative Oncology Support Practitioner |
| GMC Registration | Operating OUTSIDE GMC registration |
| Diagnosis | Did NOT diagnose malignancy |
| Oncological Treatment | Did NOT direct oncological treatment |
| Prescribing | Did NOT prescribe cytotoxic therapy |
| Acute Care | Did NOT assume responsibility for acute/emergency care |

### Who Held Medical Authority in UK

| Role | Person | Registration |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Oncological Decision-Making | GMC-registered Consultant Medical Oncologist | GMC |
| Chemotherapy Strategy | Prof. Justin Stebbing | GMC |
| Prescribing (steroids, antibiotics) | **Sister Maria Tam** (Nurse Practitioner) | Registered NP |

### Nature of UK Interventions

Interventions provided by Dr Laporta in the UK were **supportive and adjunctive only**:
- IV nutritional support
- Photobiomodulation
- Hyperthermia
- Symptom-directed integrative care

> "These interventions do not constitute the practice of medicine under UK law when delivered transparently and without diagnostic or prescribing authority."

---

## Steroid Allegation - Detailed Defense

### Clinical Rationale for Steroids

Systemic corticosteroids were prescribed for:
- Worsening respiratory symptoms
- Differential diagnoses: lymphangitis carcinomatosis and/or lower respiratory tract infection
- **Standard supportive therapy** to reduce inflammatory pulmonary oedema and palliate dyspnoea

### Patient's Pre-existing Condition

Ms Stoten had:
- Documented anxious predisposition
- Advanced malignancy causing distress
- Breathlessness
- Imminent international travel (additional stress)

### Reported Adverse Effects

- Profound insomnia (~2 hours sleep overnight)
- Agitation

### Defense Position on "Overdose" Allegation

> "These effects are recognised adverse reactions to systemic corticosteroids, particularly when combined with sleep deprivation. While steroid-related agitation and insomnia were acknowledged and reassurance was provided, **these effects do not constitute evidence of overdose**."

> "From a South African oncology practice context, such cumulative dosing would fall within accepted therapeutic safety limits."

### Prescribing Authority

- **All UK prescribing was done by Sister Maria Tam** (Registered Nurse Practitioner)
- Dr Laporta did NOT prescribe, control dosing, or override prescribing authority
- Exact steroid dose requires confirmation from Sister Maria Tam

---

## Antibiotic Prescription - Outstanding Item

### What Was Prescribed (London)
- Amoxicillin–clavulanate (Augmentin)
- Azithromycin

### Prescriber
- **Sister Maria Tam** (Nurse Practitioner)
- Part of structured practitioner-led workflow

### Dr Laporta's Assessment
> "We have everything we need, only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill"

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Obtain antibiotic prescription records from Maria Tam

---

## Causation Defense

### Temporal Separation

> "Ms Stoten's deterioration and death occurred weeks later in South Africa under hospital-based physician care. There is no temporal, clinical, or causal linkage between Dr Laporta's UK role and the terminal outcome."

### Timeline Supporting No Causation

| Date | Event | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| Aug 4, 2025 | Last UK treatment | London |
| Aug 8, 2025 | First Cape Town treatment | Cape Town |
| Sept 15, 2025 | Referral to Dr de Andrade | Cape Town |
| Sept 16, 2025 | Death | Cape Gate Hospital |

**Gap between UK treatment and death: 43 days**

### Terminal Trajectory Already Evident

The Sept 15 referral to Dr de Andrade documented:
- Widely metastatic ER-positive breast carcinoma
- Volatile inflammatory markers
- Hypoxic pneumonia
- Rapid clinical decline following neutropenia
- Partial response to broad-spectrum antibiotics

> "This referral confirms that the severity of illness and terminal trajectory were clinically evident prior to hospital admission."

---

## Regulatory Defense (UK)

Dr Laporta:
- Did NOT practice medicine without registration
- Did NOT misrepresent his professional status
- Maintained clear referral pathways
- Deferred to GMC-registered clinicians
- Acted within lawful complementary and supportive care framework

**CQC License:** Obtained **22 September 2025**

**Note:** CQC registration was completed *after* Louise Stoten's London treatment (July-August 2025). However, this does not affect the defense position because:
- Dr Laporta was acting as a naturopath, not a medical doctor
- His interventions (IV nutrition, photobiomodulation, hyperthermia) do not constitute regulated medical practice
- All medical prescribing was done by registered NP Maria Tam
- CQC registration requirement depends on the nature of activities, not the facility itself

> "There is no basis for GMC jurisdiction or allegations of unsafe practice."

---

## Patient Autonomy

> "Ms Stoten was cognitively intact and actively involved in care decisions. She expressed a clear preference not to receive chemotherapy in London and to return to South Africa for treatment, where support systems were available. These preferences were respected."

### Additional Context (Dr Laporta Voice Note, Feb 2, 2026)

Key patient decisions documented:
1. **Declined oncology treatment in London** - Was referred to Prof Stebbing and offered oncology treatment, which she declined
2. **Chose Cape Town** - Wished to come to Cape Town for further treatment
3. **Declined emergency care advice** - Before flying to Cape Town, was advised to go to nearest EC emergency centre but preferred oral antibiotics instead

> "She had a significant cough although was stable and we advised her to go to the nearest EC emergency centre facility, but she preferred to take oral antibiotics."

This demonstrates Ms Stoten exercised informed choice throughout her care pathway.

---

## Dr Laporta's Additional Observations

### On Steroid Complaints
> "She continuously complained about steroids."

This supports the position that:
1. Patient was sensitive to/intolerant of steroids generally
2. Complaints were ongoing (not unique to one incident)
3. Clinical team was aware and responsive

### On Paul Stoten's Involvement
> "Paul was nowhere."

Suggests husband was not present during treatment period, raising questions about the basis for his detailed allegations.

### On Motive
> "This may be an inheritance issue."

Aligns with CEO's assessment: "This is possibly a reflex from their inheritance discrepancies post"

### On Referral Quality
> "The referral is sound - see dates 15th/16th Sep when passed away."

Confirms proper handover to hospital care within 24 hours of death.

---

## Conclusions from Medicolegal Documents

> "Taken together, the contemporaneous documentation confirms appropriate clinical reasoning, clear role delineation, and correct escalation of care. Ms Stoten's deterioration and death are consistent with the natural progression of advanced metastatic disease, and no evidence supports negligent care, unsafe prescribing, or misrepresentation of professional role."

|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| UK practice without license | **STRONG** | Dr Laporta acted as naturopath, not doctor; did not prescribe |
| Steroid overdose | **STRONG** | Recognized adverse effects, not overdose; within safety limits |
| Prescribing negligence | **STRONG** | All prescribing by registered NP Maria Tam |
| Caused premature death | **STRONG** | 43-day gap; terminal trajectory evident; hospital care at death |
| Poor communication | Acknowledged | Committed to improvement |

## Outstanding Items

| Item | Status | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Maria Tam's antibiotic prescription records | **CRITICAL** | HIGH |
| CQC license verification | Pending | Medium |
| Exact steroid dose confirmation from Maria | Pending | Medium |
