## Notes on Paul Stoten

Dr Laporta observed: **"Paul was nowhere."**

This suggests the husband was not present during the treatment period, raising questions about the factual basis for his detailed allegations. Combined with the CEO's note about "inheritance discrepancies," this may indicate financial motivation rather than genuine negligence concerns.
