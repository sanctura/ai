A deceased patient's husband has sent a threatening letter alleging negligence by Sanctura clinic in the treatment of his wife.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Patient** | Louise Stoten (DOB: 08/04/1969, Died: 16/09/2025) |
| **Diagnosis** | Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer |
| **Complainant** | Paul Stoten (husband) |
| **Threat** | Negligence claim, £500,000+ demanded |
| **Deadline** | 7 days from receipt (~8 February 2026) |

---

## Allegations Summary

1. Operating in London without CQC license (July/August 2025)
2. Medication "overdose" causing 28+ hours sleep deprivation
3. Repeated overdose upon arrival in Cape Town
4. Chemotherapy given when patient was too weak
5. Claims these contributed to premature death

---

## Defense Position

| Allegation | Defense | Strength |
|------------|---------|:--------:|
| No CQC license / unlicensed practice | Dr Laporta acted as naturopath, not medical doctor; no GMC jurisdiction. CQC license obtained: [DATE TBC] | **STRONG** |
| Steroid overdose | Recognized adverse effects, not overdose; within therapeutic limits | **STRONG** |
| Prescribing issues | All UK prescribing by registered Nurse Practitioner Maria Tam | **STRONG** |
| Caused premature death | 43-day gap between UK care and death; terminal prognosis already established; death under hospital care | **STRONG** |

---

## Critical Defense Points

1. **UK Practice Role:** Dr Laporta did NOT practice as a medical doctor in the UK. His role was explicitly limited to naturopath/integrative oncology support practitioner, operating outside GMC registration.

2. **Prescribing Authority:** All UK prescribing (steroids, antibiotics) was done by Sister Maria Tam, a Registered Nurse Practitioner. Dr Laporta had no prescribing authority in the UK.

3. **Causation:** Patient died 43 days after last UK treatment, under hospital-based physician care in South Africa. Prof. Justin Stebbing (GMC-registered oncologist) had already confirmed prognosis of <12 months.

## Outstanding Critical Items

### 1. Sister Maria Tam's Prescription Records - **CRITICAL**
Antibiotics and steroids prescription documentation outstanding.

> "We have everything we need, only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill."
> — Dr Laporta, Feb 2026

### 2. UK Steroid Invoicing Legality - **REVIEW NEEDED**
Sanctura invoiced Louise Stoten for steroids (Prednisolone 5mg, INV-0243, Aug 4 2025) in the UK, but these were prescribed by Sister Maria Tam, not by the clinic. Legal review needed to confirm whether Sanctura was entitled to invoice for medications prescribed by an external nurse practitioner. If not, this could expose a regulatory risk and undermine the defense separation between Dr Laporta's naturopathic role and Maria's prescribing role.

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate:** Obtain prescription records from Sister Maria Tam
2. **Immediate:** Seek legal advice on whether Sanctura's UK invoicing for Maria-prescribed steroids is compliant with UK regulations
3. **ASAP Monday:** Brief Wendy with this summary and supporting documentation
4. **This week:** Engage senior counsel through Yes to Life
5. **Before deadline:** Respond to Paul Stoten (~8 February 2026)
