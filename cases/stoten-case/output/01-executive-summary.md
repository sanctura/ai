|---|---|
| **Patient** | Louise Stoten (DOB: 08/04/1969, Died: 16/09/2025) |
| **Diagnosis** | Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer |
| **Complainant** | Paul Stoten (husband) |

## Allegations Summary

1. Operating in London without CQC license (July/August 2025)
2. Medication "overdose" causing 28+ hours sleep deprivation
3. Repeated overdose upon arrival in Cape Town
4. Chemotherapy given when patient was too weak
5. Claims these contributed to premature death

---

## Defense Position

| Allegation | Defense | Strength |
|------------|---------|:--------:|
| No CQC license / unlicensed practice | Dr Laporta acted as naturopath, not medical doctor; no GMC jurisdiction. CQC license obtained: [DATE TBC] | **STRONG** |
| Steroid overdose | Recognized adverse effects, not overdose; within therapeutic limits | **STRONG** |
| Prescribing issues | All UK prescribing by registered Nurse Practitioner Maria Tam | **STRONG** |
| Caused premature death | 43-day gap between UK care and death; terminal prognosis already established; death under hospital care | **STRONG** |

---

## Critical Defense Points

1. **UK Practice Role:** Dr Laporta did NOT practice as a medical doctor in the UK. His role was explicitly limited to naturopath/integrative oncology support practitioner, operating outside GMC registration.

2. **Prescribing Authority:** All UK prescribing (steroids, antibiotics) was done by Sister Maria Tam, a Registered Nurse Practitioner. Dr Laporta had no prescribing authority in the UK.

3. **Causation:** Patient died 43 days after last UK treatment, under hospital-based physician care in South Africa. Prof. Justin Stebbing (GMC-registered oncologist) had already confirmed prognosis of <12 months.

## Outstanding Critical Item

**Sister Maria Tam's prescription records** - antibiotics and steroids

> "We have everything we need, only loop hole is antibiotic prescription we need Maria to fill."
> — Dr Laporta, Feb 2026
