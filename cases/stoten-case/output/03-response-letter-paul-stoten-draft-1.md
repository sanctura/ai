Dear Paul,

Thank you for your message. I am deeply sorry for your loss, and I wish there was more we could have done for Louise.

When Louise first came under our care, she was already incredibly frail and pre-terminal, having been living with metastatic breast cancer since 2019. Despite this, I am grateful that the initial treatment was effective — her tumour markers dropped, and she was able to travel and spend quality time in Europe while on hormonal therapy.

When it became apparent that the disease was progressing, Louise had an X-ray in Malta and then decided to come to London for further evaluation. She was referred to Professor Justin Stebbing, a consultant oncologist, who offered her oncology treatment in London. Louise declined this and expressed her wish to travel to Cape Town for further treatment instead.

Before her departure, it was noted that she had a significant cough, although she remained clinically stable. We advised her to attend the nearest emergency centre for assessment, but she preferred to take oral antibiotics and proceed with her travel plans. A short course of steroids was also provided for her respiratory symptoms. I want to assure you that the steroids were not overdosed — the side effect of agitation is a well-known and recognised reaction to corticosteroids, particularly in someone already experiencing the stress of advanced illness and international travel.

Louise arrived safely in Cape Town, and despite our best efforts with chemotherapy and supportive care, there was either disease progression or a lower respiratory tract infection that worsened. She was referred to Dr Roger de Andrade at Cape Gate Hospital on 15 September, and sadly passed away the following day under his care.

Throughout her time with us, Louise was deeply engaged in her own care decisions. She was a remarkably courageous woman who faced her illness with extraordinary dignity.

If you would like to sit down and discuss any aspects of Louise's care in more detail, I would be happy to do so.

With sincere condolences,

**Dr James Laporta**
