# Clinical Introduction:

Patient Louise Jane Stoten, a 56-year-old female, presents with Stage IV Breast Cancer in visceral crisis, with lung, liver and skeletal metastases; and a T7 compression fracture. Her HER2 status is low positive (score 0\) and cancer cells are 100% positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, with an ESR1 mutation and a PIK3CA mutation. Past treatments include Avastin (discontinued) and Photodynamic Therapy. Current treatments include Paclitaxel, which has shown good disease control, repurposed drugs such as Fenbendazole and Dipyridamole; and pain management with Celebrex and TarginAct. A new oral hormonal therapy is being initiated. ICD-10 code C50.9.

# Key Clinical Observations & Patient Input:

Ms. Stoten is reported to be recovering excellently from recent surgery, where Dr. Durrens (Orthopaedic surgeon) was pleased with nail placement, though Dr. Trudeau noted the surgical area was exceptionally fibrous and challenging for needle access. There has been some release around muscle groups post-surgery. Addressing a specific bone is considered key for significant pain relief. Her discontinuation of Avastin simplifies the prospect of future surgeries. 

Current Paclitaxel chemotherapy has demonstrated good overall disease control. However, bone marrow function has been compromised by metastases, particularly in the pelvis, described as the "factories" for blood cell production having been "bombed," leading to reduced output. There's a concern that lowering the Paclitaxel dose excessively will reduce its effectiveness.

The patient is well-informed about and utilizes repurposed drugs and maintains a healthy diet. Her HER2 status is low positive (Exact score: 0), redirecting focus towards hormonal treatments. Cancer cells are 100% positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, an increase from historical levels; and a post-chemotherapy biopsy revealed 95% of cells were dividing. Estrogen is identified as a critical vulnerability ("Achilles heel") for the cancer cells. Previous treatments have reduced the tumor burden. The patient has an ESR1 mutation and a PIK3CA mutation.

Post-surgery, the patient's blood pressure was noted to be low; and there was concern about her red blood cell count; she opted against a blood transfusion. A recommendation was made for her to take beet Kavass to help improve red blood cell count. Her pain is currently managed with Celebrex and TarginAct, along with CBD, allowing for good sleep without drowsiness. However, Celebrex will need to be discontinued due to potential long-term cardiovascular and kidney risks.

The patient feels that overall, the disease has "calmed down a lot" and is hopefully in a phase of lower disease burden. Her recovery, despite Chemotherapy, is considered very good, attributed to her genetic makeup, strong will, and adherence to supplements. The doctor was "ecstatic" with her response. The tumor itself was also described as being "softer".

Inflammation management can be further optimized with targeted therapies. Ferroptosis induction strategies (Artemisinin, Vitamin C infusions, Hyperthermia) are considered beneficial. There's an estimated 1.5 to 3-week window (likely 2 weeks) before the tumor might reactivate if current treatment momentum is lost. A tumor sample sent for DATAR analysis is expected to provide results in a couple of weeks, likely confirming current genetic findings.

A rib removal surgery is tentatively scheduled for the end of September, contingent on a 3-4 month waiting list. This surgery is important for long-term arm function; and the preference is to conduct it after her upcoming trip, unless urgent.

# Action Plan:

* Commence oral hormonal therapy this week: Fulvestrant 2.5 mg daily and Ribociclib (dosage as prescribed).  
* Perform comprehensive blood tests (patient to be fasting): Fasting insulin, fasting glucose, fasting lipogram, fasting homocysteine, full lipogram, erythrocyte magnesium, Vitamin D, kidney function tests, electrolytes, liver function tests, LDH, full blood count with differential, iron studies, thyroid function (T3, T4), zinc, inflammatory markers (Interleukin-6, CRP), minerals (calcium, magnesium, phosphate), and tumor markers (CEA, CA 15-3, CA 125).  
* Provide prescription for 60 units (6 boxes of 10\) of "millivitamins" (injectable formulation).  
* Continue current pain medications (Celebrex and TarginAct) for now.  
* Plan to discontinue Celebrex in the near future due to long-term risks; consider alternative pain management if needed post-rib surgery.  
* Evaluate the addition of Alpelisib in approximately 6-8 weeks, based on response to Fulvestrant/Ribociclib and side effect profile.  
* Continue supportive treatments: Fenbendazole and Dipyridamole.  
* Incorporate Ferroptosis induction protocols (Artemisinin, Vitamin C infusions, Hyperthermia) in condensed treatment blocks.  
* Proceed with planned rib removal surgery (tentatively end of September), ideally after the patient's upcoming trip.  
* Review DATAR tumor analysis results (expected in approximately 2 weeks), which are anticipated to confirm current genetic findings.  
* Engage in further discussion to decide on the long-term treatment strategy (intensive phased regression vs. sequential maintenance approach).
