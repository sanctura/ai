They are the tax lawyers for Malta Co that does shell and engen.

1. We did have a licence July / August?- need to check. 
2. ⁠prescription steroids before flight - endocrine nurse Maria - not us. (Horrible because she was please for treatment to get back to Cape Town. I was in Cape Town I think?)
3. ⁠no overdose was given, certainly no medicines that would have effected her outcome - died from Covid or PE or PCP or progression - all lung related - she died in hospital Cape Gate when she got too well
Almost certain their complaint comes from the invoices

Let's take a look at AlLL the invoices Cape Town & UK; make sure all nursing notes done, and I will check what WhatsApp messages on my phone - but need London practice phone, Maria Tam, Amanda, Lara and Cape Town phone.

We keep this below the radar - please tell Lara and Ismaeel strictly below the radar for now; we also need to approach each person in confidence when requesting above information.

1. Date of CQC license 
2. ⁠prescription written by Maria; 
3. ⁠overdose analysis / short report (not overdose)
4. ⁠all Stoten invoices 
5. ⁠WhatsApp messages on all phones 
6. ⁠all referral letters etc. 
7. ⁠after these steps - ASAP Monday - involve Wendy with data in hand 
8. ⁠senior counsel (through yes to life)

This is possibly a reflex from  their because inheritance discrepancies post

Confident we can get through this but once plan built and I have seen some of the messages - we need to escalate right to the top, senior counsel and Capricorn weight behind it. This is not about negligence - it is a shark tank for money
