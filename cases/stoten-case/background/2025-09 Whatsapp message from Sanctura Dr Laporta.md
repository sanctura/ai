Dr James Laporta: Did we give me more steroids with chemo today. Wide awake with splitting headache at 4am?
Dr James Laporta: Low dose given sensitivity; necessary first dose. Likely not too last long. Sorry. We can't do less first dose, second yes, then off
Dr James Laporta: I think in light of the issues last week I should have been made aware of this and they clearly should not have been given without my knowledge or at 3pm. I have been up all night and feel very stressed and unwell. I am not prepared to have any more steroids can we find an alternative. I have not been given steroids with chemo at other clinics and clearly for good reason. This has really shaken my trust and we will need to discuss on Wednesday as I need to feel safe to heal. I did not feel safe with the care at the London clinic which is why I came back to Cape Town, but am now equally concerned.
Dr James Laporta: Hi Louise,

Feeling safe, and feeling that you have full sight of all meds within treatment protocol is essential to healing and autonomy. 

Let's upgrade comms:

1.  You have always had steroids with chemo. The dosage is usually 12mg, I had given you 2mg yesterday. This is essential to avoid any transfusion reactions as it was your first eribulin dose. You will not need this second infusion. The dose was low, but understandably still had an effect, likely exacerbated by sense of SOB and some anxiety. 

2. To note, your betanoid dosage was much higher with Paclitaxel. Not 2mg. 

3. D1 prednisone script could have been explained better from London.

4. We have started the right treatment promptly and been vigilant with your care Louise. A very complex case, that is at the top of our list. We have come to know you well. 

5. ⁠Let's lean into this tension point and work through it together so that not only protocol, but relationship and healing space can be par excellent.
