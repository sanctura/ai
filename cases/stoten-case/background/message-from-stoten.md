It has come to our attention  that you operated in London without a licence in july August.  My lawyers want to involve  the police. 
This would mean closure and arrest. We looked into this in past cases. They have so far left this to me.

I need to be assured that Louise's overdose in London will not re-occur  to anyone else and that you change your policies on prescriptions  onto of operations  using the same drugs. Results were no sleep for Louise for 28 hours and massive  trauma and loss of trust in the London clinic. 

This caused problems  for is and Louise had to travel alone. And was on oxygen when she arrived from deprivation  of sleep and over dose. 
The prescription was incomplete ,the chemist was also negligent in giving such drugs with a vauge incomplete prescription and directions for use as no does was written  down on this prescription of sorts. 

This contibrubuted to Louise’s demise we believe, and in a condition of no sleep and  in a substandard care setting she was very upset. Louise glad to capetown  where she had been previously  well cared for and looked after. 

In Capetown  Louise was again given a overdose almost on arrival. And not really interviewed as to why she was so messed up physically and emotionally. This overdose  happened  ahain to a tired and confused Louise and woud in the same manner stop her sleeping and effect her physical mental and chances for her survival. 
Then she was given chemotherapy even though she was not strong enough to handle this... 

SO 2 OVERDOSES 
First an infusion then a prescription  of similar compounds REPEATED in Capetown. 
Not being made aware of what she was taking and not told to wait as her injections would last 2 days. No Louise given a prescription and told to take twice per day. And not being made aware of the timing or side effects.  She had the same overdose  and side effects of transfusion of growth hormone then a prescription of similar growth hormone. The results were no sleep after loosing 48 hrs previously  and flying to Africa and repeating this alarming overdose. 

This needs to be investigated now. 

Ive lost Louise. LOUISE HAS LOST HER LIFE PREMATURELY. LOUISES could have lived a year. Maybe  more, but not with this level of mistakes and oversight.  A month before we travelled to 3 countries  and Louise was functioning and living well, right up to the overdose in London clinic. Which i see got a lisvence for treatment in September over 30 days late of when loise was operated on.
So previously only pain was Louises main priority to be well enough for a operation on her 3rd rib because  of nerve trapped pain. She never got to have surgery as Louise passed 26 September.  

I had to sell our house as financially we broke down. Wages and bank accounts frozen. 
 LOUISE WAS THE big earner worth 250k a year. So we were unable to plan for this sudden death of Louise I had to suffer financial losses and staff had job losses. 
So far £500,000 it has cost. And with all the sadness and stress I'm sure the courts would allow 10x this for just operations in an unlicensed clinic without the overdose  and prescription  harm. 

But I have no wish to close a clinic or both that helps so many. But we must be sure this cannot happen again. There needs to be a process. 

I leave it to you for 7 days to decide  what you would like to do to change processes and make this all right. I am not negotiating  on this settlement or the terms or process improvements.   

If I hear nothing then I will report  this methodology to the authorities in UK and south Africa.  
I have the illegal in uk prescriptions and watsapp chats saying Louise shouldn't  have taken the prescription after the infusion drip. But Louise was not told this in both incidents and the perceptions were lacking in information.  

I leave this with you for a week. 

Regards 
Paul.
