We need support managing a medical case whereby a patient passed away, and their family is now trying to press charges. Louise Stoten was a patient our clinic Sanctura treated, and was suffering from Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer. She passed away on September 19 2025. In 2025 we have now received a threatening letter from he husband Paul Stoten who believes we've acted negligently. Sanctura's CEO and lead doctor believes we've acted in good faith and always followed best practices. Please can you review the information i've assembled so far and create an information-base folder with a consolidated set of information of we've put together. There are also various files in the background and background/invoices folder that have information. Here is also a brief explanation of each files intention. It's important you read the PDF supplied, so if this is unable to be read, please inform me so we can make a plan to consider this information.
