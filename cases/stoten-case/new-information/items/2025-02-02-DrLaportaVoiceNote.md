I think we need to just do a very short email response - obviously we'll work through it today - to what Paul wrote regarding Louise Soton just to say we're really sorry that there's not more we could have done for Louise when we first saw her, and then just give the date that I first saw her. She was incredibly frail and pre-terminal, fortunately the medication worked and her tumour markers dropped, she was able to travel and spend quality time in Europe on hormonal blockers. At that time it appeared there was progression, she was sent for an X-ray in Malta and then decided to go to London for treatment. She was referred to Professor Stebbing for treatment and offered oncology treatment there which she declined and wished to come to Cape Town for further treatment. It was noted that she had a significant cough although was stable and we advised her to go to the nearest EC emergency centre facility, but she preferred to take oral antibiotics and some steroids were given. The steroids were certainly not overdosed and the side effect of agitation is well-known. Luckily she arrived safely in Cape Town and despite our best efforts there was progression or lower respiratory tract infection which worsened and she passed away in hospital under the care of Dr. De Andrade. I think that's all it needs to say and then if there are any further - if you would like to sit down and discuss in detail some of the aspects, I'd be happy to do that."
