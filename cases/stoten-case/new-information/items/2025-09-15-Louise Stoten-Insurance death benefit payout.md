**Re:** Mrs. Louise Stoten (DOB: 08/04/1969) – Terminal Illness Certification & Request for Accelerated Life Insurance Payout

Dear Sir or Madam,

I write as the treating physician of Mrs. Louise Stoten to formally confirm her medical condition and prognosis in support of her life insurance claim. Mrs. Stoten is a 56-year-old patient with **advanced metastatic breast cancer** (estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative) that has spread extensively to her lungs, manifesting as **lymphangitic carcinomatosis**. This end-stage disease has caused severe respiratory failure, and she is now **oxygen-dependent** for all activities of daily living.

Mrs. Stoten’s condition is **unequivocally terminal**. Multiple oncologists involved in her care – including Professor Justin Stebbing (Imperial College London) – have independently assessed her and concur that she is in the final stage of illness with a **life expectancy well under 12 months**. In fact, given the aggressive progression of her cancer, it is highly unlikely she will survive beyond a few months. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis of this nature is recognized in medical literature as an **end-stage manifestation of malignancy**, typically conferring a **very poor prognosis (average life expectancy around six months)** [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560921/#:~:text=Diagnosis%20of%20pulmonary%20lymphangitic%20carcinomatosis,reported%20with%20currently%20available%20management).

Her death in the near future is a **medical certainty**, despite exhaustive treatment efforts. Mrs. Stoten has **exhausted all available therapies** – including standard and experimental treatments sourced globally – yet the disease continues to progress. There are no remaining curative or life-prolonging interventions. Even the most aggressive measures have failed to halt her cancer, and further invasive support or experimental options are considered **futile in such end-stage disease** [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560921/#:~:text=Proved%20or%20suspected%20lymphangitic%20carcinomatosis,and%20family%20members%20to%20help). Our focus has necessarily turned to palliative care and ensuring her comfort in the time she has left.

In light of Mrs. Stoten’s terminal status, I hereby **request the immediate activation of her life insurance policy’s death benefit as an early, lump-sum payout** under the policy’s terminal illness provisions. Given that her life expectancy is definitively below 12 months, this request is wholly consistent with standard insurance practice allowing early access to the death benefit in cases of terminal illness [cancerresearchuk.org](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/practically/money/life-insurance#:~:text=Some%20life%20insurance%20policies%20include,is%20included%20in%20your%20policy). Indeed, Aviva’s own literature affirms that **“terminal illness benefit”** (a form of accelerated death benefit) is included with life cover and **pays out while the insured is alive if they have exhausted all treatment options and have less than 12 months to live** [aviva.co.uk](https://www.aviva.co.uk/insurance/life-products/critical-illness-cover/knowledge-centre/terminal-illness-vs-critical-illness/#:~:text=Terminal%20illness%20benefit%20differs%20from,12%20months%20left%20to%20live). Mrs. Stoten unquestionably meets these criteria. Activating an **accelerated death benefit** now will fulfill the intent of her policy by providing support when it is needed most – *before* death, given that death is impending.

Beyond the contractual justification, there are compelling **ethical and humanitarian reasons** to grant this payout **immediately**. Allowing Mrs. Stoten to receive her life cover benefit now will enable her to **maintain dignity and comfort** in her final months, funding optimal palliative care and relieving the significant financial strain on her and her family. It would be inhumane to force a terminally ill individual to await actual death for financial relief that could alleviate suffering now. Even industry regulators echo this principle: patients with a terminal diagnosis should not have their remaining time “**marred by having to wait or chase for a claims decision**,” and should be supported **promptly** so they can put their affairs in order [fca.org.uk](https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/review-terminal-illness-benefits-within-life-insurance-protection-products#:~:text=,are%20better%20enabled%20to%20pursue). In short, paying out the policy at this juncture is not only **medically and legally warranted**, but also the **right and compassionate action**. It will allow Mrs. Stoten to use the funds for her comfort, to secure her family’s future, and to approach the end of life with some peace of mind and dignity.

Time is of the essence. All medical evidence definitively confirms that Mrs. Stoten’s condition is terminal and that her **death is imminent**. I urge Aviva to **expedite disbursement** of her life insurance benefit **without delay**. Early payment of this claim will serve the very purpose for which life insurance exists and honor both the letter and spirit of the policy. Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information or documentation you require; I am prepared to provide whatever is needed to facilitate an immediate payout.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

Yours faithfully,
