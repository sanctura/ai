# breakdown of the current running cost per HBOT session, based on oxygen gas usage, together with VAT and a proposed markup.

**Gas usage assumptions**

- Oxygen consumption remains constant regardless of pressure or ATA (1.0 ATA to 2.4 ATA).
- Flow rate has been reduced to the lowest safe operational level of 220 litres per minute.
- This translates to a gas cost of R19.92 per minute.
- Session duration is therefore the sole cost driver.

**Current gas cost per session (excluding VAT)**

- 45-minute session: R896.21
