# Compressor can replenish oxygen in the tanks and bring running costs down

We are currently investigating compressor options that can integrate directly with the existing manifold. A 250L compressor would reduce oxygen costs to a fraction of current levels; however, the capital outlay is approximately R250,000 per unit. At present, one unit would suffice, with a potential requirement for a second unit as utilisation increases. This will be presented separately for consideration.

Until such time as a compressor solution is implemented, the above represents the true running cost and recommended interim pricing for HBOT sessions.

## Some background when looking for other options

Normal filtered air is cheaper than *delivery* of O2 tanks, which is what we are comparing against now. Pressurising with filtered air is what we were looking at before we found a better O2 tank supplier.

Medical gas for compression only (if we had a bulk tank) would be cheap per volume, but the rental/installation/consent issues make it unviable vs tanks.

Solution is simpler: better O2 tank supplier found (half price) and installer reducing flow rate (less O2 used per session).

240L vs 450L achieved by installer reducing flow rate setting on the machine.

Microbulk obstacles: Not used for medical gas in SA, logistical/site issues for installation.

Price per session O2 tank: Still getting final confirmation from new supplier, but initial indications show significant saving per tank/session vs old supplier.
