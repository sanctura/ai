# Sanctura Invoicing Model - Detailed Process Guide

## 1. Background & Rationale

### Why the Change?

The previous retrospective invoicing model created significant operational challenges:

- **Revenue leakage** - services delivered but never invoiced or invoiced late
- **Administrative burden** - staff time spent chasing payments
- **Reconciliation complexity** - difficulty matching services to payments
- **Patient confusion** - unexpected bills arriving weeks after treatment
- **Cash flow unpredictability** - unclear when revenue would be realised

As Sanctura grows across UK and South Africa, with increasing treatment complexity, this model became unsustainable.

### The Solution

A shift to **real-time, upfront-aligned billing** that:

1. Invoices services as they happen
2. Collects payment at point of service (default)
3. Offers structured packages for committed patients
4. Requires prepayment for high-cost items
5. Maintains clinical flexibility for genuine circumstances

---

## 2. Real-Time Invoicing

### Definition

Services are invoiced **at the time they are delivered**, or no later than the same day.

### Scope

This applies to all service categories:

- Consultations (initial, follow-up, specialist)
- Supplements and dispensed products
- IV infusions and drips
- Hyperthermia sessions
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
- Any other billable service

### Operational Process

1. **Service delivered** - clinician/nurse completes treatment
2. **Capture in system** - service logged immediately
3. **Invoice generated** - same-day invoice created
4. **Payment collected** - before patient leaves (default)
5. **Receipt issued** - confirmation provided to patient

### Benefits

- No missed charges
- Clear audit trail
- Simplified end-of-day reconciliation
- Patient knows exactly what they owe, when

---

## 3. Payment on the Day (Default)

### The Standard

Unless otherwise arranged, patients pay for services on the day they are delivered.

### Applies To

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Consultations | Initial consults, follow-ups, specialist reviews |
| Supplements | Vitamins, nutraceuticals, dispensed medications |
| Ad-hoc treatments | Single IV sessions, one-off therapies |

### Process

1. Service completed
2. Invoice presented at reception
3. Payment collected (card, cash, transfer)
4. Receipt provided
5. Patient departs

### Exceptions

- Patients on package credits (drawdown from prepaid balance)
- Patients with pre-agreed deposit arrangements
- Clinical discretion scenarios (documented)

---

## 4. Packages (Discounted Upfront Commitments)

### Purpose

Packages reward patients who commit to structured treatment protocols by offering a discount in exchange for upfront payment.

### Suitable For

- Multiple hyperthermia sessions (e.g. 10-session protocol)
- Multiple HBOT sessions
- Structured integrative protocols
- Patients preferring single payment over multiple transactions

### Structure

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Discount** | 15-20% off standard tariff |
| **Payment** | Full amount upfront |
| **Credit balance** | Created on patient account |
| **Usage** | Credit drawn down as sessions delivered |

### Critical Rule: Protecting Package Value

Packages are priced assuming the discount applies to the **intended treatments only**.

To prevent margin erosion:

- **Supplements** should be paid separately, on the day
- **Consultations** should be paid separately, on the day
- **Additional treatments** outside the package scope should be paid separately

If patients draw down package credit for non-package items, the intended discount benefit is diluted.

**Staff guidance:** Encourage patients to pay separately for items outside their package.

### Example

> Patient purchases 10-session hyperthermia package at 20% discount.
>
> - Hyperthermia sessions: drawn from package credit
> - Consultation during treatment block: paid on the day (not from package)
> - Supplements prescribed: paid on the day (not from package)

---

## 5. Optional Deposits

### Purpose

Some patients prefer to minimise payment touchpoints. Deposits allow them to prepay a sum that is drawn down against services.

### Key Characteristics

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Mandatory?** | No - entirely patient-elected |
| **Amount** | Pre-agreed between patient and clinic |
| **Reconciliation** | Weekly or monthly statements provided |
| **Transparency** | Full visibility of balance and usage |

### Suitable For

- Patients attending frequently (multiple times per week)
- Family-managed finances (third party paying)
- Patients who prefer not to handle payment each visit
- International patients settling in advance

### Process

1. Patient requests deposit arrangement
2. Amount agreed with finance/reception
3. Deposit paid and credited to account
4. Services delivered and logged in real-time
5. Charges deducted from deposit balance
6. Regular statements sent
7. Top-up or settlement as balance reduces

### Important Note

Deposits are **not discounted**. They are simply prepayment at standard rates for convenience. Discounts apply only to packages.

---

## 6. High-Cost Items - Prepayment Required

### Rationale

Certain items carry significant cost to the clinic and cannot be returned or resold if the patient does not proceed. The clinic cannot carry this risk.

### Examples

| Item Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Genetic panels | Circulating tumour DNA, pharmacogenomics (£2,000+) |
| Specialised medications | Imported or custom-compounded drugs |
| Custom-ordered stock | Patient-specific items ordered from suppliers |

### Rule

> **Payment must be received before the item is ordered** once a defined cost threshold is exceeded.

### Process

1. Clinician recommends high-cost item
2. Patient informed of cost and prepayment requirement
3. Patient agrees and makes payment
4. Payment confirmed by finance
5. Item ordered from supplier
6. Item received and administered/dispensed

### Threshold

A specific monetary threshold should be defined (e.g. £500 or £1,000). Items below this may still be invoiced on the day at clinical discretion.

---

## 7. Cancellation Policy

### Context

Sanctura operates with high demand and limited capacity. Cancelled appointments represent:

- Lost treatment slots that could serve other patients
- Allocated staff time that cannot be recovered
- Reserved machine/room capacity wasted

### Standard Charges

| Notice Period | Charge Applied |
|---------------|----------------|
| Less than 24 hours | 50% of session value |
| Less than 1 hour / no-show | 100% of session value |

### Clinical Discretion

The clinic recognises that cancer patients face unpredictable circumstances:

- Acute illness or infection
- Emergency oncology treatment changes
- Hospital admissions
- Unavoidable medical events

In these cases, cancellation charges may be **waived at the clinic's discretion**. This is not automatic - it requires assessment and approval.

### Stock and Consumables

**No charge** applies for medications or consumables that were:

- Not issued to the patient
- Not mixed or prepared
- Not used

Cancellation charges relate to **time and capacity**, not unused physical items.

---

## 8. Medical Aid Positioning

### Sanctura's Position

Sanctura does **not** bill medical aid schemes directly. This is a deliberate operational decision.

### Patient Responsibility

1. Patient pays Sanctura directly (upfront or on the day)
2. Patient submits claim to their medical aid
3. Medical aid reimburses patient (if applicable)

### Sanctura Support

Sanctura provides:

- **Medical-aid-compliant invoices** with correct codes and formatting
- **Support letters** where motivation is required
- **Clinical documentation** to support claims
- **Guidance** on submission process

### Tariff Alignment

Sanctura's tariffs are:

- Aligned with recognised health tariffs
- Benchmarked against UK, EU, and South African standards
- Competitive within integrative oncology markets

## 9. Roles and Responsibilities

### Operational Accountability

| Activity | Primary Responsibility |
|----------|----------------------|
| Capturing treatments & consumables | Nursing team (real-time) |
| Logging consultations | Clinician / Reception |
| Managing high-cost item payments | Reception / Finance |
| Package sales and setup | Finance / Accounting |
| Collecting payments | Reception |
| Retrospective audits | Bookkeeper / Finance |
| Approving clinical overrides | Medical leadership |

### Principles

- **Segregation of duties** - no single person controls entire process
- **Real-time capture** - log as you go, not at end of day
- **Escalation paths** - clear routes for exceptions and overrides

---

## 10. Transition from Legacy Model

### Historical Gaps

Due to retrospective billing practices, there may be:

- Unbilled services from previous periods
- Partially collected invoices
- Unreconciled patient balances

### Approach

1. **Time-bound audit** - identify recoverable items within defined lookback period
2. **Pragmatic write-offs** - some legacy losses may be accepted
3. **Forward focus** - priority is implementing new model, not endless backward recovery

### Principle

> **Forward control matters more than backward recovery.**

Energy should be invested in preventing future leakage, not chasing diminishing historical returns.

---

## 11. Summary

The Sanctura invoicing model operates on these foundations:

1. **Invoice in real-time** - as services are delivered
2. **Collect on the day** - payment at point of service (default)
3. **Offer packages** - discounted bundles for committed patients
4. **Accept deposits** - optional prepayment for convenience
5. **Require prepayment** - for high-cost items above threshold
6. **Apply cancellation policy** - with clinical discretion for genuine circumstances
7. **Support medical aid claims** - but do not bill directly

This creates a sustainable, scalable, patient-friendly billing model that supports Sanctura's growth while maintaining clinical flexibility and patient trust.
