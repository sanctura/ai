# Sanctura Invoicing & Payment Strategy  
*A Comprehensive Framework for Real-Time, Patient-Centric Billing*

---

## 1. Executive Context & Problem Statement

Sanctura currently operates with a **retrospective invoicing model**, whereby services are delivered first and invoices are generated and chased after the fact. While workable at low scale, this model has created:

- Revenue leakage due to missed or delayed invoicing  
- Administrative burden and payment chasing  
- Poor alignment between clinical delivery and financial control  
- Increased reconciliation complexity  
- Patient confusion and friction around delayed billing  

As service volume, treatment complexity, and geographic footprint (UK & South Africa) increase, this model is **no longer sustainable**.

The executive team therefore aligned on a **fundamental shift** toward **real-time, upfront-aligned billing**, with flexibility for patient experience and clinical realities.

---

## 2. Strategic Objectives

The new invoicing strategy is designed to:

1. **Eliminate retrospective billing risk**
2. **Improve cash flow predictability**
3. **Align billing with real-time clinical delivery**
4. **Preserve patient dignity, trust, and flexibility**
5. **Support high-cost and variable treatments safely**
6. **Enable discounts without margin erosion**
7. **Scale operationally across locations**

---

## 3. Overview of Considered Approaches

### Approach 1 – Retrospective Billing (Current / Deprecated)
- Invoice after services rendered  
- Weekly or delayed payment collection  
- High leakage and admin burden  

**Decision:** Explicitly rejected.

---

### Approach 2 – Real-Time Billing, Pay-on-the-Day
- Invoice generated as services occur  
- Payment required daily  

**Challenges Identified:**
- Operational bottlenecks at reception  
- Friction for patients attending multiple sessions per week  
- Dependency on third-party payers / family members  
- No incentive for upfront commitment  

---

### Approach 3 – **Preferred Approach**
**Packages + Real-Time Invoicing + Deposit Option**

This approach balances:
- Financial control  
- Patient flexibility  
- Clinical unpredictability  
- Operational simplicity  

**Chosen as the primary strategy.**

---

### Approach 4 – Large Deposit + Top-Up Trigger
- Substantial upfront deposits  
- Credit drawdown with automated triggers  

**Considered viable**, but carries higher patient anxiety and reconciliation complexity if not carefully managed.

---

## 4. The Preferred Model (Approach 3)

### Core Pillars

1. **Real-Time Invoicing**
2. **Payment on the Day (Default)**
3. **Optional Deposits**
4. **Discounted Packages**
5. **Upfront Payment for High-Cost Items**
6. **Clear Cancellation Policy**
7. **Clinical Discretion Overrides**

---

## 5. Real-Time Invoicing Principles

### Definition
Real-time invoicing means:
- Services are invoiced **at the time they are delivered**, or
- No later than the **same day**

This applies to:
- Consultations  
- Supplements  
- IV infusions  
- Hyperthermia  
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)  

### Benefits
- Eliminates missed charges  
- Improves financial transparency  
- Simplifies reconciliation  
- Aligns billing with care delivery  

---

## 6. Payment Rules by Service Category

### 6.1 Consultations & Supplements
- **Paid on the day**
- Invoiced in real time
- Prices published via tariffs / website
- Medical aid reclaim handled by patient (with Sanctura support)

---

### 6.2 Packages (Discounted Upfront Commitments)

Packages are designed for patients undergoing:
- Multiple hyperthermia sessions
- Multiple HBOT sessions
- Structured protocols

#### Key Principles
- Paid **upfront**
- Discount range: **15–20%**
- Create a **monetary credit balance**
- Credit can be applied across services

#### Important Clarification
To preserve package value:
- Patients are **strongly encouraged** to pay for:
  - Supplements
  - Consultations
  - Additional treatments  
  **as they go**
- Otherwise, those charges may draw down package credit prematurely

This prevents:
- Discount reappropriation
- Margin erosion
- Misalignment of intended benefit

---

### 6.3 Deposit Option (Optional, Not Mandatory)

For patients who prefer:
- Fewer payment touchpoints
- Larger upfront settlement
- Family-managed finances

Sanctura may accept:
- Pre-agreed deposit amounts
- Credit reconciled weekly or monthly
- Full transparency via statements

Deposits are:
- **Optional**
- **Patient-elected**
- **Reconciled regularly**

---

### 6.4 High-Cost Tests, Medications & Stock

Examples:
- Genetic panels (e.g. £2,000+)
- Specialised medications
- Custom-ordered stock

**Rule:**
> Payment is required **before ordering** once a defined threshold is exceeded.

Rationale:
- Stock is non-returnable
- Supplier costs are incurred immediately
- Risk must not be carried by the clinic

Lower-cost, ad hoc items may still be invoiced on the day.

---

## 7. Cancellation Policy

Given high demand and constrained capacity:

### Standard Policy
- **< 24 hours notice:** 50% charge  
- **< 1 hour notice / no-show:** 100% charge  

### Clinical Discretion
Sanctura recognises:
- Acute illness
- Emergency oncology treatment changes
- Unavoidable medical events  

In such cases:
- Charges may be waived **at the clinic’s discretion**
- Compassion and reasonableness apply

### Stock & Consumables
- **No charge** for medication or consumables:
  - Not issued
  - Not mixed
  - Not used

Charges relate to:
- Lost treatment slots
- Allocated staff time
- Reserved machine capacity

---

## 8. Medical Aid Positioning

- Sanctura does **not bill medical aid directly**
- Patients pay Sanctura upfront
- Patients reclaim from medical aid independently
- Sanctura provides:
  - Medical-aid-compliant invoices
  - Support letters
  - Documentation where applicable

Tariffs are:
- Aligned with recognised health tariffs
- Benchmarked against UK, EU, and South African standards
- Competitive within integrative oncology markets

---

## 9. Operational Responsibility Model (High-Level)

| Activity | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| Treatments & consumables | Nursing team (real-time capture) |
| Consultations | Clinician / reception |
| High-cost goods | Reception / finance |
| Packages | Finance / accounting |
| Payment processing | Reception |
| Retrospective audit | Bookkeeper / finance |
| Clinical override decisions | Medical leadership |

Segregation of duties ensures:
- Accuracy
- Accountability
- Scalable control

---

## 10. Transition & Legacy Invoicing

- Historical gaps may exist due to retrospective practices
- A **time-bound audit** will identify recoverable items
- Some legacy losses may be written off pragmatically
- Priority is **forward control**, not endless backward recovery

---

## 11. Summary of the Chosen Model

**Sanctura will operate on:**
- Real-time invoicing  
- Payment on the day by default  
- Optional deposits  
- Discounted upfront packages  
- Mandatory prepayment for high-cost items  
- Clear, compassionate cancellation rules  

This creates:
- Financial sustainability  
- Operational clarity  
- Patient trust  
- Clinical autonomy
