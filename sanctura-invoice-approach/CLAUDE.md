# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository for Sanctura's invoicing and payment strategy. Sanctura is a medical practice (integrative oncology) operating in the UK and South Africa. The repository contains no code - only markdown documentation for planning and rolling out a new real-time invoicing model.

## Repository Structure

- `background/` - Strategic context and executive discussions
- `invoicing-rollout/` - Operational documentation for the new invoicing model

## Key Context

The documentation describes a transition from retrospective billing to real-time invoicing using Xero as the accounting platform. Key elements:

- Real-time invoicing at point of service delivery
- Payment on the day (default)
- Discounted upfront packages (15-20% off)
- Optional patient deposits
- Prepayment required for high-cost items
- Cape Town rollout first, then UK

## Working with this Repository

When creating or editing documents:
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing markdown files
- Use tables for structured information (payment rules, responsibilities, timelines)
- Keep summary documents concise; detailed guides can be comprehensive
- Number documents with prefixes (01-, 02-, 03-) to indicate reading order
