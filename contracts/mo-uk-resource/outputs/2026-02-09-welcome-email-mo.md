**Subject:** Welcome to Sanctura - Your First Day Tomorrow

Hi Mo,

Welcome to Sanctura! We're really pleased to have you on board and looking forward to working together.

Just a few things ahead of your first day tomorrow:

**Getting Set Up**
Your Sanctura account is ready to go. I'm flying in tomorrow so you may arrive before me - Amanda will be there to help get you set up and connected to the wifi.

**Tools We Use**
- **Google Mail & Calendar** - for all email and scheduling
- **Asana** - for task management. I've set up an Asana board for your tasks and we can work through it together when I'm in

If you have any questions before tomorrow, just drop me a message.

Looking forward to getting started with you.

Best,
Grant
