# Payroll Request — New Supplier Setup (Forward to Kinari)

Hey Kinari,

Are you able to assist me with this in order to pay our new consultant Mohammed Desai?

Mo is using PayStream as his umbrella company. They need us to complete the attached supplier form and provide proof of our bank account before they can onboard us and process payments.

Could you please:
1. Complete and return the attached form to PayStream
2. Provide them with proof of our bank account (screenshot of statement or online banking, dated within the last 3 months — see their example attached)

Here's a summary of the engagement and expected costs so you have the full picture:

**Consultant:** Mohammed Desai
