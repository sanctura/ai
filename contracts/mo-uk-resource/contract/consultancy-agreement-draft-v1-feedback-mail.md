I haven't seen this agreement before.
You are right to be cautious when engaging self-employed contractors, as there are strict UK rules regarding worker misclassification. Ultimately, if someone is being paid a gross amount via invoice but could reasonably be considered an employee, this may create tax and employment status risks. I’m happy to put together a checklist for you to use going forward to help assess whether an individual is genuinely self-employed.
In that context, having an open-ended consultancy agreement does not strongly support a genuine self-employed relationship. A shorter, project-by-project approach would be preferable. If Mohammed takes holiday and there is a natural break between contracts, that can also help demonstrate separation between engagements.
I also noticed that the rate of pay referenced in your email does not align with the rate stated in the contract. I assume this may be a typo following the 15 hours mentioned, but I wanted to flag it as part of my review.
