## Working With This Repository

When asked to analyze or summarize:
1. Read relevant files from **background/** for source material
2. Create structured summaries in **information-base/** with numbered prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.)
3. Place communications and deliverables in **output/**

The information-base files are designed to be read together as a complete picture of the situation, candidate, contract issues, and decision status.
