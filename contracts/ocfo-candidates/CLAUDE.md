# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository for tracking the hiring of an interim CFO/Financial Manager for Sanctura (a multi-entity medical practice group). It contains no code - only markdown documents and PDFs related to the hiring decision.

## Structure

- **background/** - Source documents: candidate CVs (PDF), interview transcripts, contracts (PDF), external analysis
- **information-base/** - Synthesized summaries and analysis created from background materials
- **output/** - Generated communications and deliverables (e.g., WhatsApp messages, emails)

## Context

The organization is in a time-critical situation: the sole Financial Manager (Alida) is leaving 23 February 2026, creating urgency around hiring interim coverage. Key entities span South Africa (5) and UK (2), using Xero for accounting.

## Working With This Repository

When asked to analyze or summarize:
1. Read relevant files from **background/** for source material
2. Create structured summaries in **information-base/** with numbered prefixes (01-, 02-, etc.)
3. Place communications and deliverables in **output/**

The information-base files are designed to be read together as a complete picture of the situation, candidate, contract issues, and decision status.
