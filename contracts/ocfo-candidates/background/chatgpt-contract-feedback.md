---

## 2. Key Things to Watch Out For (High-Impact Issues)

### 🔴 1. No clear termination / exit clause

The letter says the agreement:

> “will remain effective until it is replaced by mutual agreement”

⚠️ **Problem**

* There is **no explicit right for you to terminate** for convenience.
* No notice period stated.
* No clarity on early exit if performance is poor or circumstances change.

✅ **What to request**

* Mutual termination right with **30 days’ notice**
* Immediate termination for cause (misconduct, non-performance, breach)

---

### 🔴 2. Scope creep risk via “Continuous scoping”

They reserve the right to reassess scope based on:

* Transaction volume
* Complexity
* Hours of support

⚠️ **Problem**

* This allows **unilateral scope and fee pressure** without hard caps.
* No clear definition of what triggers a price increase.

✅ **What to request**

* Written agreement required before **any scope or fee change**
* Explicit confirmation that **R110k/month is fixed for 6 months**
* Clear KPI-based scope definition

---

### 🔴 3. Liability cap is very low

Liability is capped at:

> fees paid in the **preceding 6 months**

⚠️ **Problem**

* For CFO-level advice, this is a **very low protection**.
* Excludes consequential loss and loss of profits entirely.

✅ **What to request**

* Increase liability cap to **12 months of fees**, or
* Explicit carve-out for **gross negligence or wilful misconduct**

---

### 🔴 4. Non-solicitation clause is aggressive (24 months)

You may not hire or contract with their staff for **24 months**, or pay:

* **240 hours × last billing rate**

⚠️ **Problem**

* 24 months is long
* Penalty is high and fixed, not loss-based

✅ **What to request**

* Reduce restriction to **12 months**
* Apply **only to the named CFO**, not all personnel
* Cap penalty to a **reasonable recruitment fee**

---

### 🔴 5. Payment mechanics are vague

The contract references:

* Debit order
* “100% of the total retainer”

⚠️ **Problem**

* No payment date
* No invoice terms
* No linkage to actual service delivery

✅ **What to request**

* Monthly invoicing **in arrears**
* Clear payment terms (e.g. **30 days from invoice**)
* Right to withhold payment for non-performance

---

### 🔴 6. Dependence on a single named individual

The service is explicitly tied to **one person**.

⚠️ **Problem**

* No clause covering what happens if they are unavailable, resign, or are substituted.

✅ **What to request**

* Right to approve any replacement
* Fee reduction or termination right if the named CFO is unavailable
* Minimum handover requirements

---

## 3. Missing Clauses You Should Ask to Add

These are **standard for senior financial roles** but absent here:

1. **Clear deliverables**

   * Monthly outputs (management accounts, forecasts, board packs, etc.)
2. **Performance standards / KPIs**
3. **Confidentiality survival clause**

   * Should survive termination explicitly
4. **IP ownership**

   * All work product belongs to *Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd*
5. **Governing law & jurisdiction**

   * Not clearly stated (assumed SA, but should be explicit)

---

## 4. Inflation Increase Clause – Red Flag for Fixed-Term Contract

They reserve:

> CPI +2% to CPI +4% annual increases

⚠️ **Problem**

* This is a **6-month contract**, so inflation adjustments are inappropriate.

✅ **What to request**

* Remove inflationary increases entirely for this engagement

---

## 5. Suggested Negotiation Summary (You can copy/paste this)

> We’re comfortable with the commercial intent, but before acceptance we’d like to:
>
> 1. Add a 30-day mutual termination clause and immediate termination for cause
> 2. Confirm fees are fixed for the 6-month term with no scope changes without written approval
> 3. Adjust the non-solicitation period to 12 months and limit it to the named CFO
> 4. Clarify payment terms, invoicing, and service commencement date
> 5. Add protections relating to unavailability or substitution of the named CFO
> 6. Remove inflationary adjustments for this fixed-term engagement

---

## 6. Overall Risk Rating (My view)

**Commercial risk:** ⚠️ Medium
**Legal risk:** ⚠️ Medium–High
**Operational risk:** ⚠️ Medium

➡️ **This is a fairly standard OCFO contract**, but it is **written heavily in the provider’s favour** and **needs tightening** before you sign.
