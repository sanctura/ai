---

**Complexity:** 7 legal entities across UK and South Africa

---

## Part 1: The Departure Crisis

### Who is Leaving

**Alida Wiese** has been the sole Financial Manager for Sanctura, holding comprehensive responsibility for all financial operations across the entire group. Her tenure spans many years, during which she has accumulated extensive institutional knowledge that is largely undocumented.

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **26 Jan 2026** | Resignation notice given |
| **28 Jan 2026** | Xero live for new invoicing system |
| **7 Feb 2026** | Staff must be ready for independent operation |
| **23 Feb 2026** | Alida's last working day |
| **24 Feb onwards** | Post-departure operations begin |

**Operational Finance:**
- All invoicing and quoting (patient and inter-company)

## Part 2: The Time Crunch

### Why This is Critical

**Knowledge Concentration Risk:** Alida holds the only comprehensive view of financial operations. No single internal person can replace her. Most processes exist only in her head.

**Capacity Constraints:** The internal team is already at full capacity:
- **James La Porta (CEO):** Clinical lead + CEO duties; cannot take operational work
- **Grant Merwitz (MD):** Recently transitioned to MD; would be overwhelmed
- **Yaseen Harneker (CPO):** Only limited capacity for banking operations backup
- **Ricardo Delgado (Director):** Oversight role, not hands-on execution
- **Kyle/Amanda (Practice Managers):** Site operations, not financial management

**Compliance Deadlines:** Multiple statutory deadlines throughout the year with penalties for non-compliance. Key near-term:
- La Porta Industries UBO & Annual Returns: 6 Feb
- Saint Raphael FY charge revision: 13 Feb
- February stock count: 20-22 Feb
- Annual forecast: End Feb

**Invoicing Transformation:** A major invoicing project is going live 28 Jan (Xero cutover). Without proper support, this could fail at the worst possible time.

### The 4-Week Window

| Week | Dates | Critical Focus |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Week 1** | 26 Jan - 1 Feb | Xero live, OCFO engaged, initial handover |
| **Week 2** | 3-7 Feb | Training, staff ready for independent operation |
| **Week 3** | 10-14 Feb | Teams run independently, Alida support only |
| **Week 4** | 17-23 Feb | Final handover, edge cases only |

**Hard Stop:** 23 February 2026 - Alida is gone. Everything must be handed over or documented by this date.

---

## Part 3: Why OCFO Urgently

### The Decision

OCFO is being engaged as an urgent interim solution to bridge the gap between Alida's departure and a permanent hire.

### What OCFO Can Provide

**Critical Clarification:** OCFO is a consultancy that can provide different resources based on need:

| Option | Description | Fit for Sanctura |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Fractional CFO** | Strategic/oversight | Useful for guidance |
| **Bookkeeper** | Day-to-day operations | Essential for continuity |
| **Both** | Scaled to need | Recommended approach |

### Recommended Interim Scope

**In Scope (OCFO Should Deliver):**
- Bookkeeping (Xero – all 3 SA/UK orgs)
- Bank reconciliation
- Supplier payment loading
- Payroll data preparation
- Monthly management accounts
- Weekly KPIs
- Cash flow monitoring
- Debtors oversight
- Compliance calendar tracking
- Invoicing support (SA operations)
- Process documentation
- Invoicing transformation project support

**Out of Scope (Cannot Be Replaced):**
- SARS payment release (James only – cannot be delegated)
- Strategic board-level decisions
- HR/people management
- Clinical operations
- UK operations (Kinari leads; OCFO provides emergency backup only)

### Why External Support is Necessary

1. **Immediate Capacity:** Professional support bridges gap until permanent hire (target Q2 2026)
2. **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces knowledge loss and maintains statutory compliance
3. **Operational Continuity:** Bookkeeper function transfers from Alida to OCFO
4. **Project Support:** OCFO can support invoicing transformation (critical dependency reduction)
5. **Documentation:** External expertise for process documentation and best practices
6. **Flexibility:** Can scale hours/days per week based on actual need

### Engagement Parameters

| Parameter | Expectation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Initial Term** | 3 months (February-April 2026) |
| **Review Point** | End of March |
| **Extension** | Based on permanent hire progress |
| **Commercial** | To be negotiated with candidate |

---

## Part 4: Entity Complexity

The OCFO candidate must understand they are supporting a multi-entity, dual-jurisdiction organization:

### United Kingdom (2 Entities)

**Sanctura Limited** – Operating medical clinic
- Accounting: Xero
- Banking: Barclays + Revolut
- External Support: Kinari (accountant) handles most UK operations
- VAT: Not registered (medical exemption)

**Sanctura Holdings** – UK Holding Company
- Fully managed by Kinari
- Minimal OCFO involvement expected

### South Africa (5 Entities)

**James La Porta Inc** – Medical practice (primary income generator)
- Accounting: Xero + Healthbridge invoicing
- Banking: Investec
- VAT registered
- Key Functions: Patient invoicing, quoting, medical supplier payments
- **Critical:** Dual control for payments; SARS releases by James only

**Saint Raphael** – Management services company
- Accounting: Xero
- Banking: Investec (shared)
- Role: Employs all staff, holds assets, non-medical operations
- Key Responsibility: Supplier payments, payroll processing
- Property Management: Multiple leases

**James's Personal Trust**
- Administrator: Atlantic Trust (Bokelman transition deferred)
- FM role: Instruct trust for payments, process employees

**TTC** – Owned by Janine
- Minimal involvement; annual income tax filing only

**La Porta Industries**
- Compliance: Annual returns and UBO submissions

### Payment Controls (Critical)

**South Africa Dual Control System:**

| Role | Person | Can Release |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Level 4 (SARS Only) | James La Porta | SARS payments only |
| Standard | Alida Wiese | Non-SARS payments |
| Standard | Yaseen Harneker | Non-SARS payments |

**Critical Risk:** James is the only person with Level 4 access for SARS payments. No backup exists.

**Post-Transition Model:** OCFO/Bookkeeper loads payments → Grant or Yaseen releases (dual control maintained)

---

## Part 5: External Service Providers

The OCFO candidate will need to coordinate with existing service providers:

### Primary Partners

**Inaura (South Africa)**
- Services: Payroll, PAYE, VAT, financial statements, income tax
- Entities: James La Porta Inc, Saint Raphael, TTC
- Note: Historical quality concerns; needs monitoring

**Kinari (United Kingdom)**
- Services: Banking, payroll, PAYE, financial statements, income tax
- Assessment: Strong relationship; handles most UK operations
- UK Holding Company fully managed

**Imperium Registrations**
- Services: Annual returns, UBO submissions, secretarial, CIPC compliance

### Insurance

**Intersure (South Africa):** Policy management, claims
**Ashley Page (UK):** Policy management, claims

### Other

- **Atlantic Trust:** Current trust administrator
- **TAFTS:** Equipment financing
- **Optiworx:** HR policies (files need handover)

---

## Part 6: The Invoicing Transformation Opportunity

### Context

A major invoicing transformation project is underway, shifting from centralized to decentralized (point-of-service) invoicing. This is directly relevant to the OCFO engagement.

### Current State (Problem)

- Alida invoices retrospectively (not at point of service)
- Financial manager creates all invoices (central dependency)
- Single point of failure: If Alida unavailable, invoicing stops
- Payment requires chasing after the fact

### Future State (Solution)

- Nurses & reception invoice at point of delivery
- Real-time invoicing for treatments, consultations, medications
- Financial manager/bookkeeper audits (not executes)
- Payment collected on the day (default)

### Why OCFO Should Care

1. **System Live 28 Jan:** Xero cutover happening immediately
2. **Training Required:** Staff need support during transition
3. **Audit Role:** OCFO takes over audit/oversight from Alida
4. **Documentation:** OCFO helps document the new processes
5. **Phase 2 Optimization:** Post-departure improvements need leadership

### Three-Phase Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Timing |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Survive** | Basic codes, laminated checklist, presentable invoices | Go-live → stable |
| **Phase 2: Optimise** | Pricing improvement, missed charges, audit rules | Post-departure |
| **Phase 3: Automate** | CRM integration, Xero API, marketplace apps | Future |
