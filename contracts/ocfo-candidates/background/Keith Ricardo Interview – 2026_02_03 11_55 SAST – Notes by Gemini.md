NEEDS FURTHER DISCUSSION

**Automate Real-Time Financial Reporting**

Executive team seeks real-time, weekly, or daily financial view to inform decision-making, moving beyond manual Excel consolidation for timely executive snapshots. Implementing automation for reporting is necessary, especially consolidating data from different zero instances and integrating budget targets not currently housed in zero.

**Finalize Keith Harrod Contract Duration**

Candidate Keith Harrod is offered initial contract of 3 to 6 months through OCFO, but candidate only wants to commit to 4 months due to OCFO commission structure. Grant Merwitz needs to negotiate contract terms with OCFO regarding duration and potential permanent conversion after initial term.

**Investigate Keith Contract Options**

Grant investigates possibility of two- to four-week probation exit clause, six-month extension option, and permanent hiring costs for Keith's contract.

ALIGNED

**Establish Two-Person Finance Structure**

Long-term finance structure requires senior financial manager or CFO-level person and bookkeeper for administrative tasks. Current contract hire, Keith Harrod, helps bridge gap, assisting in financial accounts, forecasting, and potentially hiring bookkeeper.

**Complete Financial Audit Within Six Months**

Next financial audit completion must happen within six months after year-end, not the current nine to ten months.

**Keith Contract Length Extended**

Keith contract length agreed to be four months, instead of three months, to ensure sufficient working time after settling in.

**Start Recruitment for Permanent CFO**

Immediately after Keith joins, team must start looking for permanent CFO and bookkeeper; Keith helps with bookkeeper recruitment.

**Lexi Cash Bonus Process**

Team prefers grossing up cash bonus for Lexi and putting through payroll as bonus, instead of issuing cash on side, to avoid wrong message.

*More details:*

* **Introductions and Candidate Overview**: Grant Merwitz introduced Keith Harrod, a candidate for a fractional CFO role who is being brought in quickly to manage a financial manager handover and begin director-level activities ([00:00:00](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.7znspd8p3s6k)). Dr James Laporta, the CEO, and Ricardo Delgado and Andrew, who sit on the director's board, were also introduced ([00:00:51](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.56db214ekdiz)). Ricardo Delgado, the CFO for Capricorn Private Equity, explained they are responsible for overseeing the Sanctura investment ([00:01:51](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.avqpi4fhel1m)).

* **Sanctura's Financial Challenges and Context**: Ricardo Delgado noted that Sanctura faces significant challenges, particularly within the finance function over the last six months, and that discussions have centered on the optimal finance function structure across London and South Africa. Although the Cape Town clinic has been running for multiple years, they view the overall business as a startup, especially given the clinic opening in London in May and the subsequent growth ([00:02:55](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.c026w5duytml)).

* **Candidate's Icebreaker and Background Understanding**: Keith Harrod started by attempting to break the ice, noting they looked up Andrew on LinkedIn and commented on their academic distinctions ([00:03:50](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.jhn3wrndi1sq)). Keith Harrod then shared their understanding of Sanctura's structure, which consists of a medical practice started in Cape Town, a subsequent entity in the UK, and a holding company owned by Capricorn and other shareholders ([00:05:44](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.uxfh32c7ey67)).

* **Keith Harrod's Professional Experience in Publishing and Retail**: Keith Harrod decided to summarize their relevant experience, mentioning they are from Pietermaritzburg. They spent six years with the Witness Group, a publishing and printing operation that was a holding company with about eight subsidiaries and an aggregate turnover of about 400 million ZAR ([00:06:57](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.b45vmiud62rf)). Keith Harrod began as a financial manager there and later left as a financial director, subsequently moving to Durban to work with Massmart in retail and wholesale for eight years, where they focused on commercial and backend finance, including FPNA management ([00:08:30](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.bydjola5bacx)).

* **Experience with Telecommunications Startup (Smile Communications)**: Keith Harrod then discussed their six years in Johannesburg with Smile Communications, a telecommunications startup that launched in Nigeria in 2014 ([00:08:30](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.bydjola5bacx)). This was a massive operation operating on a funding model with substantial equity from Saudi Arabian shareholders and debt funding from DFIs and African banks, with infrastructure rollout being city by city in countries like Nigeria and Uganda ([00:09:40](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.7mw0efddyh3i)). They managed a large finance profile, leading forecasting, budgeting, and management accounts ([00:11:03](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.mhfwownfnka2)).

* **Reason for Leaving Smile Communications**: When asked why they left Smile Communications, Keith Harrod explained they were headhunted for a role at Janet Media Consulting. The company was behind on its forecast, and the biggest challenge experienced was the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira against the USD, as revenue was earned in local currency, leading to a huge problem ([00:12:22](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.i51j8885lpoc)). The company defaulted on a covenant and missed a capital repayment, which made the company's long-term prospects look unstable ([00:13:42](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.mopno02z8czr)).

* **Experience with Janet Media Consulting**: Keith Harrod explained that Janet Media Consulting was a smaller, more relevant company for comparison to Sanctura's current maturity stage. The company had only 12 people, and in finance, it was Keith Harrod and one other person; Keith Harrod was responsible for management accounts, budgets, consolidations, and setting debtor policies, as the financial director had to handle nearly everything ([00:15:06](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.awdxvouq17c8)). The cumulative turnover for this group was about 150 million ZAR ([00:16:28](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.v5dw1bti6zcw)).

* **Insourcing Finance Function at Janet Media Consulting**: Keith Harrod joined Janet Media Consulting after the owners, who were moving to Portugal, decided to bring the historically outsourced finance function in-house ([00:17:30](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.4jb57dcmkssm)). This required Keith Harrod to rewrite policies and procedures for debtors, credit application forms, and bank/cash payments, and they had to manage the inventory and monthly stock counts ([00:18:42](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.83bstwrlx46s)). The company used Sage for pure finance and a separate Sage platform for payroll, which Keith Harrod managed in-house ([00:19:44](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.krt50ru6d1lz)).

* **Reason for Leaving Janet Media Consulting**: Keith Harrod left Janet Media Consulting because they were unhappy living in Johannesburg and prioritized quality of life, which they felt was better near the seaside in Cape Town. They noted that while their career and income doubled by moving to Johannesburg, their quality of life downscaled due to poor infrastructure, stating that Cape Town is a beautiful place ([00:22:18](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.29fexye25uay)) ([00:24:27](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.750oweo1o9r2)).

* **Cash Management Practices at Janet Media Consulting**: When asked about cash management, Keith Harrod explained they would conduct a weekly cash flow forecast for the next 30 days, doing so with good accuracy by estimating receipts from the top 10 customers on a weekly basis ([00:24:27](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.750oweo1o9r2)). The company maintained good margins and was well-funded, always operating as a cash-generating unit with positive cash flow ([00:25:33](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.kdft6uy7pml)). Keith Harrod was also responsible for providing the shareholder with 6-month and 12-month cash flow forecasts focused on tax payments and dividend availability ([00:26:32](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.lbdrrips31b9)).

* **Involvement in Financial Statements and Technical Finance**: Keith Harrod confirmed they had heavy involvement in technical finance at Smile Telecoms, which was audited by PWC and had to be IFRS compliant ([00:27:33](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.6dbsb08ne91q)). They were involved in a massive system change to implement per-second billing due to a new revenue recognition standard ([00:28:44](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.1fxd6pm7mk1q)). At Janet Media Consulting, which was a smaller company, the IFRS standards were less strenuous ([00:29:54](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.oxm1njz5i254)).

* **Current Consulting Work and Future Plans**: Since moving to Cape Town in February, Keith Harrod has been doing contract and consulting work through companies like Outsource CFO, with engagements lasting three to four months. They are currently doing this work but are unsure if they will continue next year, stating they might return to the permanent private sector ([00:30:58](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.rdaoa7zcwqi7)).

* **First 30 Days and Cash Flow Forecasting for Sanctura**: Ricardo Delgado emphasized the critical need for an accurate cash flow forecast for Sanctura due to significant investment in personnel and a need to track the agreed funding ([00:32:18](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.dqtv9bzcwqgb)). Keith Harrod noted that since the majority of the 20 personnel expenses are predictable, the tricky part is forecasting revenue ([00:33:31](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.qd9m5tldw05c)). Keith Harrod confirmed they would need to understand the revenue model and review historical revenue data, suggesting that Grant Merwitz and Dr James Laporta, who are responsible for business, have existing models to inform future cash flows ([00:35:35](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.lueo81rtbkpx)).

* **Need for Real-Time Financial Views**: Grant Merwitz expressed a strong need for a real-time view of Sanctura's financial state, possibly daily or weekly, to aid in decision-making and tracking against targets and expense budgets, especially since they are now fully utilizing Zero ([00:36:39](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.y4tqy59g390s)). Keith Harrod suggested that they could extract the income statement and cash flow budgets from the ERP system into Excel and create visibility by comparing weekly targets against actual sales orders ([00:39:50](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.mi9netuedugw)). Keith Harrod stressed the importance of tracking revenue by week, which allows stakeholders to step in by the third week if targets are not being met ([00:40:54](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.bdb7hwbicud0)).

* **Automating Financial Data Exposure**: Grant Merwitz noted that data visibility is currently delayed because one person must manually pull reports from different instances of Zero, consolidate them in Excel, and then share the executive snapshot ([00:41:52](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.izcagqsq5tbx)) ([00:43:56](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.e8plhfh8txch)). Keith Harrod argued that Zero reports are straightforward to pull and convert to Excel and that anyone with access to the ERP could generate the necessary factual information ([00:42:50](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.1qa30v7wwdb9)). Grant Merwitz stressed the need for automation to avoid manual delays, concluding that Keith Harrod's experience suggests they understand the landscape well enough to discuss automation ([00:43:56](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.e8plhfh8txch)).

* **Personal Life and Commute to the Office**: When asked about their personal life, Keith Harrod stated they are happy living in Blouberg, Cape Town, and intend to stay there ([00:45:58](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.njz6j8jpjany)). They live with their mother after ending a seven-year relationship last year. Regarding the commute to the office, they anticipated a typical one-hour commute each way, which they considered normal compared to other cities ([00:46:45](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.g4ihm31cmw60)).

* **Contract Duration and Future Plans**: Keith Harrod asked about the contract length, which Grant Merwitz confirmed is a six-month fixed contract through Outsource CFO, though they were initially seeking three to six months ([00:47:48](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.lej27zexju5a)). Keith Harrod stated a minimum commitment of three months is acceptable, suggesting four months to avoid the substantial commission fee Outsource CFO receives and to allow time to assess the situation between three and six months ([00:48:46](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.wu8x8x71ytwl)) ([00:50:56](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.gjmv7gdj52a9)). Grant Merwitz noted that the long-term plan involves potentially hiring a senior financial manager and a bookkeeper ([00:49:50](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.ekuz2p5i3psz)).

* **Questions for the Directors**: Keith Harrod asked if the payroll is outsourced, which Grant Merwitz confirmed it is, requiring them to issue monthly instructions for payment. Keith Harrod also asked about the financial year-end (February) and the audit deadline, which Ricardo Delgado confirmed is about nine months after year-end, although they would prefer it completed within six months ([00:52:56](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.bnqgky5xsxge)). Ricardo Delgado clarified that the audit for the previous year was pending due to the closure of a bank account, which was resolved in December ([00:53:46](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.oqygq9bd05n3)).

* **Internal Assessment of Candidate and Strategy**: Following the interview, Ricardo Delgado expressed that Keith Harrod could potentially do the job, noting their immediate availability is a major asset for job shadowing and working with the incumbent before they depart. Ricardo Delgado viewed the Janetta experience as valuable, believing Keith Harrod to be hardworking ([00:54:41](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.nxqt4pqm7y2s)). The team concluded that since the hire is a contract through Outsource CFO, they should proceed with a three-to-four-month contract to pick up tasks and implement processes, with the potential of having Keith Harrod help hire a bookkeeper ([00:56:28](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.1t4wc4g45q5q)).

* **Interim CFO Contract Discussion**: Ricardo Delgado and Grant Merwitz discussed the urgent need to hire an interim CFO named Keith due to the lack of time and the existing organizational difficulties. They agreed that the engagement should start with a four-month contract to serve as a short-term fix, with an option to extend. Grant Merwitz noted that OCFO, the agency providing Keith, likely charges an exorbitant fee and expressed a desire to seek other options for a permanent solution ([00:58:34](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.l1x7a89xgnw0)).

* **Strategy for Permanent Financial Leadership**: Ricardo Delgado advised immediately starting the search for a permanent CFO, even while Keith is engaged. They emphasized the importance of also finding a bookkeeper and getting that base established, noting that Keith could potentially assist with the bookkeeper's recruitment ([00:59:22](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.jfea61tvoy5a)). Grant Merwitz wanted to explore the possibility of extending Keith's contract to six months and understanding the process for hiring them permanently .

* **Keith's Remuneration and Permanent Hire Fee**: Grant Merwitz speculated that Keith might be unhappy with the remuneration from OCFO and would want more money for a longer contract ([01:00:28](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.1oc7ly1vuxt8)). Ricardo Delgado suggested that if Keith proves to be a superstar, they would have to negotiate a recruitment fee, which is often 25–30% of the annual wage in London, with either OCFO or another party ([00:59:22](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.jfea61tvoy5a)). Grant Merwitz planned to resolve all contract details, including extension options and permanent hiring fees, quickly so Keith could start .

* **Petty Cash Request from Alita**: Ricardo Delgado brought up Alita's email regarding an urgent need for James to access funds via petty cash. Ricardo Delgado did not believe the company should operate with physical cash and wondered if Alita meant a card instead ([01:00:28](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.1oc7ly1vuxt8)). Grant Merwitz speculated that James might want to give someone a cash bonus, possibly to avoid tax deductibility or reporting it as a wage ([01:02:06](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.9jz2nrha6oiz)).

* **Resolution of Petty Cash/Bonus Issue**: Grant Merwitz agreed to ask Alita to clarify the need for the petty cash. Ricardo Delgado expressed a preference to gross up the bonus amount to cover any taxes Lexi would owe and put it through payroll, rather than giving cash on the side, as using cash sends the wrong message ([01:02:06](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.9jz2nrha6oiz)). Grant Merwitz believed James's request was likely an "old school" or "back of the napkin" approach to giving a bonus ([01:02:58](?tab=t.kywfeutbxiwe#heading=h.mggj6qssudye)).

* **Finalizing Keith's Contract Details**: Grant Merwitz confirmed that the plan is for a four-month contract, and they will seek a two- to four-week probationary exit clause if they are unsatisfied with Keith's performance . Grant Merwitz expressed a desire to have all contract matters resolved quickly so Keith could start working, ideally before Grant Merwitz travels to London, though they acknowledged a start "tomorrow" is a stretch .

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Grant Merwitz will ask Alita to understand what she is asking about regarding the urgent need for access to funds.  
- [ ] Grant Merwitz will get information resolved about Keith's four-month contract, including a two to four-week probation exit, the possibility of extending to six months, and the option to take him on permanently.
