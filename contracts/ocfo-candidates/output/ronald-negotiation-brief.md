**For:** Siraj
**Negotiating with:** Lushia Van Buuren (LVB Consulting)
**Contact:** Lushiavb@lvbconsulting.co.za / 082 635 3335
**Date:** 4 February 2026

## Decision

**We are proceeding with Ronald Mushonga.**

---

## Our Position

### Rate

| Item | Ronald's Ask | Our Position |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Monthly rate | R110,000 | **Negotiate lower if possible** |
| Travel/accommodation | Unclear | **Included in rate - full package, no extras** |

The R110k must be all-inclusive. We are not paying travel and accommodation on top.

### Contract Term

| Item | Our Position |
|------|--------------|
| Initial term | **4 months** |
| Extension option | **Option to extend to 6 months** |

### Work Arrangement

| Period | Arrangement |
|--------|-------------|
| **First month** | **Full-time on-site in Cape Town** (non-negotiable given handover urgency) |
| Month 2 onwards | 2 weeks in Cape Town / 2 weeks remote (as Ronald proposed) |

---

## Agency Fees (LVB Terms)

Per their standard terms for contract placement:
- R801,000+ annual CTC = **12% of contract value**
- 4-month contract at R110k = R440k contract value
- Agency fee = ~R52,800 + VAT = **~R60,720**

If we negotiate rate down to R100k:
- 4-month contract = R400k
- Agency fee = 12% = R48,000 + VAT = **~R55,200**

**Note:** Contracts <3 months billed as minimum 3 months. No guarantee on contract placements.

## Negotiation Talking Points

1. **Rate negotiation:**
   - "We're keen to proceed with Ronald but need the rate to work within budget"
   - "R110k needs to be fully loaded - inclusive of all travel and accommodation"
   - "For a 4-month commitment with extension option, can we agree on R100k/month all-in?"

2. **First month on-site:**
   - "Given the urgency of handover (current FM leaves 23 Feb), we need Ronald on-site full-time for at least the first month"
   - "After month 1, we're open to the 2 weeks in / 2 weeks out arrangement he proposed"

3. **Contract structure:**
   - "4-month initial term with mutual option to extend to 6 months"
   - "What does the extension process look like - same terms or renegotiated?"

4. **Agency fee confirmation:**
   - "Can you confirm the agency fee structure for this engagement?"
   - "Is the 12% calculated on the full contract value?"
