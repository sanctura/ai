# Draft Email Response to OCFO

**Status:** Draft - pending review

Hi Lwazi,

Thanks for sending the proposal through. We're keen to proceed with Keith and want to move quickly given our timeline - our current FM's last day is 23 February.

Before we accept, there are a few points we'd like to address:

**Contract amendments:**

1. **Duration** - We'd like to start with a 4-month term rather than 6, with an option to extend if needed.

2. **Termination** - The current wording ("mutual agreement") doesn't give either party a clear exit. We'd like to include a 30-day notice clause for either party, plus immediate termination rights for cause.

3. **Probation period** - Given the urgency of the hire, we'd like a 2-4 week exit clause if the arrangement isn't working for either side.

4. **Fee certainty** - Can you confirm the R110k/month is fixed for the term? The "continuous scoping" language suggests fees could change.

5. **Inflation adjustment** - For a short-term engagement, the annual CPI adjustment shouldn't apply. Can this be removed?

6. **CFO availability** - If Keith becomes unavailable, we'd need approval rights over any replacement and a proper handover. Can this be included?

**Questions:**

7. **Permanent hire** - If we decide to hire Keith permanently after the engagement, what would the terms/fee be?

8. **Payment terms** - The process mentions payment upfront. For a professional services engagement at this level, we'd expect monthly invoicing in arrears. Is this negotiable?

Happy to jump on a call if easier to work through these.

Regards,
Grant
