Hi Siraaj,

Thanks for the updated draft. I've made a few final corrections and the latest version is attached.

Changes I've made:

1. **Removed "Inc" remnants** - Three places still had "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd Inc" from the original template (Clauses 8, 10, and 11). Cleaned up.
2. **Updated finance email** - Changed the invoice submission email in Clause 4 from accounts@drjameslaportainclife.com to accounts@sancturalife.com.
3. **Fixed US legal terminology** - Replaced "federal, state, local" tax references in Clause 4 with South African equivalents, and updated Clause 12 similarly.
4. **Clause 3a wording** - Changed "minimum 40 hours per week" to "full-time basis (40 hours per week)" to align with the flat rate billing.
5. **Typo fix** - "Harley Stret" → "Harley Street" in the notices section.

Two items I noticed that are still in the template from your side:
- **Clause 1** is missing a full stop between "mutual written agreement" and "The agreement can also be terminated..."
- **Clause 8.4** references "Clause 20.c. Arbitration" but Arbitration is actually Clause 16.c.

If you can correct those two, I think we're good to go. Should we send this to Ronald to sign first, and I'll countersign once his signature is on?

Regards,
Grant
