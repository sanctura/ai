**RONALD MUSHONGA - INTERVIEW PREP**

CA(SA), ACA, CPA | 15+ yrs | R110k/mo + R60k agency fee
Total 4mo: R500k (Keith = R440k)

**Experience:**
- RDG Collective: Raised $10m+, rebuilt finance team, found fraud
- Air Chefs (SAA): Business rescue, led team of 12
- Huge Telecom: JSE compliance, M&A, ExCo chair

**Strengths:** Crisis mgmt, capital raising, governance, team building

**MUST PROBE:**
1. Xero experience? (we use it across 7 entities)
2. Hands-on or just strategic? (we need someone doing the work)
3. Multi-country experience? (UK compliance)
4. Small org fit? (no team, he's it)

**KEY QUESTIONS:**
- "Walk me through your cash flow forecasting approach"
- "At RDG, were you doing the books or managing others?"
- "First 30 days here - what would you do?"

**RED FLAGS:**
- Talks governance but not execution
- Expects support staff that don't exist
- Can't explain specific methodology

**vs KEITH:**
Keith = hands-on confirmed, R60k cheaper
Ronald = stronger CV, crisis experience, but unproven on execution

**BOTTOM LINE:**
Is the extra R60k worth it? Does he DO the work or MANAGE the work?
