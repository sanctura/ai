## 2. Why Ronald Was Hired

### The Crisis

Sanctura's sole Financial Manager (Alida Wiese) resigned on 26 January 2026 with a last day of 23 February 2026. She held the only comprehensive view of financial operations across 7 entities, with most processes undocumented and existing only in her head. No internal person could replace her.

### Selection Process

Ronald was sourced through LVB Consulting (agent: Lushia) and interviewed on 3 and 4 February 2026. He was selected over Keith Harrod (sourced through OCFO) based on:

- **Ricardo Delgado's assessment:** "Preferred over Keith - much more on the pulse and capable of doing the job better"
- **Stronger cash flow methodology:** 13-week rolling forecast vs Keith's 30-day approach
- **More detailed team-building plan:** proposed specific structure rather than generic hiring
- **Crisis experience:** business rescue and fraud detection background
- **Higher engagement level** during interviews

### Background Checks

All background checks completed by LVB on 8 February 2026 - no concerns raised. SARS tax clearance valid until 5 February 2027. Company (Clearshell) fully compliant with CIPC, annual returns filed consistently 2020-2025.

The immediate priority. Overlap with Alida was 10-23 February (13 days).

## 8. Approach Ronald Proposed

From his interview, Ronald outlined his methodology:

**First 90 days (Diagnosis):**
1. Do hands-on work to learn "the entire story"
2. Meet with auditors immediately - they highlight problem areas fast
3. Identify gaps and develop job descriptions
4. Design and implement 13-week cash flow forecast
5. Hire bookkeeper/processor by Month 2-3 (subject to MD approval)

**Cash flow methodology:**
- 13-week rolling forecast (more robust than typical 30-day approaches)
- Match financial commitments with inflows
- Proactively renegotiate supplier terms where necessary
- "Stop being reactive"

**Team structure proposed:**
```
Financial Manager (Ronald)
    +-- Junior 1: Payables + Collections
    +-- Leverage: Nurses for invoicing (decentralised model)
```

> "I'm willing to get my hands dirty... doing the operational work in the first month allows me to learn the entire story."

## 9. Risk Factors & Constraints

| Risk/Constraint | Detail |
|-----------------|--------|
| **13-day handover only** | Alida's last day was 23 Feb; limited overlap for knowledge transfer |
| **Undocumented processes** | Most financial processes existed only in Alida's head |
| **No banking access** | Ronald cannot load or release payments - creates dependency on Grant |
| **SARS Level 4 bottleneck** | Only James has Level 4 access for SARS payments; no backup |
| **Inaura quality concerns** | Historical issues with current SA accounting service provider |
| **Independent contractor** | Not an employee - no probation, supervision must be outcome/deliverables-based |
| **Joburg-based** | Ronald travels from Johannesburg; covers own travel from his rate |
| **Concurrent system change** | Invoicing transformation (Xero decentralised model) going live during handover |
| **7 entities across 2 countries** | Complex group structure requiring coordination across jurisdictions |
