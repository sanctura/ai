# Email to Siraaj - Contract Feedback (ICA Draft One)

**Date:** 9 February 2026
**To:** Siraaj
**From:** Grant Merwitz
**Subject:** RE: Independent Consultant Agreement - Clearshell / Ronald Mushonga - Feedback on Draft One

---

Hi Siraaj,

Thanks for getting this through so quickly, and good to hear that the background checks came back clean.

I've reviewed the draft agreement and have the following feedback:

### 1. Contracting Entity Must Change

The agreement is currently between **Dr James Laporta Inc** and Clearshell Management Solutions. This needs to change to **Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd**. All references to "Dr James Laporta Inc" throughout the agreement must be replaced with "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd". The contact for Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd should be grantm@sanctura.co.uk.

### 2. Statement of Work (Annexure A)

I've completed the full Statement of Work - please find it attached. Please replace the blank Annexure A with this version. The key fields:

- **Job Title:** Fractional CFO
- **Reports To:** Grant Merwitz (Managing Director)
- **Consultant:** Clearshell Management Solutions (Pty) Ltd

The SOW includes phased deliverables, ongoing responsibilities, payment controls, and a review schedule.

### 3. Option to Extend is Missing

Your email refers to the contract as "4 months with option to extend", but the agreement itself has no extension or renewal clause. It simply terminates on 9 June 2026. Please add a clause that allows the contract to be extended by mutual written agreement.

### 4. Flat Monthly Billing (Clause 3)

Clause 3c requires invoices to include "the number of labor hours worked", and Clause 3b references timesheets. This doesn't align with our arrangement. We've agreed to a flat monthly rate of R115,000 (ex VAT), not hourly billing. Please amend Clauses 3b and 3c so that invoicing is on a flat monthly basis, with the February invoice pro-rated for the actual start date.

### Summary of Changes Required

| # | Change | Section |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | Replace "Dr James Laporta Inc" with "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd" throughout | All |
| 2 | Update Saint Raphael contact to grantm@sanctura.co.uk | Clause 16i (Notices) |
| 3 | Replace blank Annexure A with attached Statement of Work | Annexure A |
| 4 | Add option to extend by mutual written agreement | New clause or amend Clause 1 |
| 5 | Change from hourly invoicing to flat monthly billing, with pro-rata for February | Clauses 3b and 3c |

Please send through Draft Two with these changes and the attached SOW incorporated, and we can get it to Ronald for signature.

Regards,
Grant
