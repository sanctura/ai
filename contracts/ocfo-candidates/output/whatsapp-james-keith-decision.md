**My recommendation: Sign Keith this week.**

The facts:
- 20 days until Alida leaves
- My contact only available 1 April - market is tight
- Bokkelman/network leads are speculative with no timeline
- I'm not a finance person and I'm in London from Monday

Keith isn't a permanent decision - it's a 4-month bridge. Question isn't "is he perfect long-term" but "can he keep the lights on while we find that person."

If Bokkelman or your network produces someone better, the 30-day termination clause gives us an exit.

The expensive mistake isn't R440k for Keith. It's having no one when Alida walks out.

What do you need from me to move forward?
