# Situation Overview

## The Crisis

**Organization:** Sanctura (multi-entity medical practice group)
**Trigger:** Alida Wiese (sole Financial Manager) resigned 26 January 2026
**Last Day:** 23 February 2026 (4 weeks notice)
**Urgency:** Critical - immediate interim support required

---

## Why This is Critical

### Knowledge Concentration Risk
- Alida holds the **only comprehensive view** of financial operations across 7 entities
- Most processes exist only in her head (undocumented)
- No single internal person can replace her

### Capacity Constraints
| Person | Role | Available Capacity |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| James La Porta | CEO + Clinical Lead | None for operational work |
| Grant Merwitz | MD (recently transitioned) | Would be overwhelmed |
| Yaseen Harneker | CPO | Limited banking backup only |
| Ricardo Delgado | Director | Oversight only, not hands-on |
| Kyle/Amanda | Practice Managers | Site operations, not finance |

### Compliance Deadlines at Risk
- La Porta Industries UBO & Annual Returns: 6 Feb
- Saint Raphael FY charge revision: 13 Feb
- February stock count: 20-22 Feb
- Annual forecast: End Feb
- Bi-monthly VAT submissions (SA)
- PAYE coordination

### Concurrent System Change
- Major invoicing transformation going live **28 January 2026** (Xero cutover)
- Staff training required for point-of-service invoicing
- Risk of failure at worst possible time

## Entity Complexity

### South Africa (5 Entities)

| Entity | Purpose | Accounting |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **James La Porta Inc** | Medical practice (primary income) | Xero + Healthbridge |
| **Saint Raphael** | Management services, employs staff | Xero |
| **James's Personal Trust** | Personal, administered by Atlantic Trust | External |
| **TTC** | Owned by Janine, minimal | Annual tax only |
| **La Porta Industries** | Compliance entity | Annual returns/UBO |

### United Kingdom (2 Entities)

| Entity | Purpose | Support |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Sanctura Limited** | Operating clinic | Kinari handles most |
| **Sanctura Holdings** | Holding company | Fully managed by Kinari |

---

## Critical Banking Controls

**South Africa Dual Control System:**

| Role | Person | Authority |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Level 4 (SARS Only) | James La Porta | SARS payments only |
| Standard | Alida Wiese | Non-SARS payments |
| Standard | Yaseen Harneker | Non-SARS payments (backup) |

**Critical Risk:** James is the only person with Level 4 access for SARS payments. No backup exists.

**Post-Transition Model:** OCFO/Bookkeeper loads payments → Grant or Yaseen releases

## The 4-Week Handover Window

| Week | Dates | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| Week 1 | 26 Jan - 1 Feb | Xero live, OCFO engaged, initial handover |
| Week 2 | 3-7 Feb | Training, staff ready for independent operation |
| Week 3 | 10-14 Feb | Teams run independently, Alida support only |
