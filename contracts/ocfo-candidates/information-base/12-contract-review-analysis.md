## Critical Issues Requiring Action

### 1. Statement of Work (Annexure A) is BLANK

**Priority: URGENT**

The SOW (Annexure A) has no content - the Job Title, Reports To, and scope fields are all empty. This is the most critical issue:

- Siraaj explicitly stated: *"Grant to establish a clear scope of work with clear outcomes within the week to ensure it is a legally binding agreement"*
- Without a defined SOW, the agreement may not be enforceable
- Invoice approval is tied to the SOW: *"based on timesheets submitted or based on the review of the agreed scope of work in line with the requirements of the SOW attached"* (Clause 3b)

**Action required:** Grant must draft the SOW with:
- Job title (e.g., "Interim Financial Manager / CFO Consultant")
- Reporting line (e.g., "Managing Director - Dr James Laporta")
- Key deliverables and outcomes
- Performance metrics for the outcome-based review

### 2. No Mention of February Return Flight

**Priority: MEDIUM**

The negotiated agreement includes Sanctura covering Ronald's February return flight (Joburg ↔ Cape Town), reimbursed by the practice. This is not reflected anywhere in the contract.

- Clause 5 explicitly states: *"Dr James Laporta Inc will not be liable to pay the Independent Consultant any Employee Benefits (i.e., medical, dental, vision, vacation, sick leave, accommodation travel or any other costs incurred unless mutually agreed.)"*
- The flight reimbursement should be documented as a "mutually agreed" exception, or in the SOW

**Action required:** Add the February return flight reimbursement as a specific exception in the contract or SOW.

### 3. No Extension Clause

**Priority: MEDIUM**

Siraaj's email describes the contract as *"4 months with option to extend"*, but the contract itself has a fixed end date of 9 June 2026 with no extension mechanism.

**Action required:** If an extension option is desired, add a clause allowing mutual agreement to extend, or a renewal mechanism.

## Items to Review / Potential Concerns

### 4. Contracting Entity is Dr James Laporta Inc

The contract is with **Dr James Laporta Inc** (Reg: 2021/361823/21), not with Sanctura or any of the 7 practice entities directly. This means:
- James's entity is the contracting party and bears the contractual obligations
- Invoice payments come from / through Dr James Laporta Inc
- This is likely correct for the group structure but worth confirming it's intentional

### 5. Client Communication Restriction (Clause 15)

> *"Consultant shall not communicate directly with or take direction from any of Dr James Laporta Inc's clients relating to the Services defined in this Agreement, unless expressly authorized to do so by Dr James Laporta Inc."*

This needs clarification. As interim Financial Manager, Ronald will need to communicate with:
- SARS, CIPC, and other regulators
- Banks and financial institutions
- Possibly patients/clients of the practice entities
- External auditors, bookkeepers, etc.

**Action required:** Either:
- Remove/amend this clause for this specific engagement, or
- Include blanket authorization in the SOW for Ronald to communicate with necessary third parties in the course of his duties

### 6. Unilateral Change Authority (Clause 8)

Dr James Laporta Inc can unilaterally change scope, time, place, and method of work without notice. The Consultant has only 15 days to assert adjustment rights. While this gives management flexibility, it's quite one-sided.

**Note:** This is standard in many consulting agreements but worth being aware of.

### 7. One-Sided Indemnification (Clause 13)

Only the Consultant indemnifies Dr James Laporta Inc. There is no reciprocal indemnification. This means if Dr James Laporta Inc's actions cause losses to the Consultant, there's no contractual protection.

**Note:** Common in client-drafted agreements, but Ronald/his advisors may push back.

### 8. Invoice Content Requirements (Clause 3c)

Invoices must include:
- Consultant's name, address, telephone number
- Services performed
- Billing rate
- Number of labour hours worked

This means Ronald needs to track and report hours, not just submit a flat monthly invoice. This is consistent with the 40hr/week specification.

### 9. VAT Handling

The rate is stated as R115,000 **ex VAT**. Ronald's company (Clearshell) is VAT-registered (VAT: 4840282430). This means:
- Ronald will invoice R115,000 + R17,250 VAT = **R132,250 per month**
- Dr James Laporta Inc can claim the input VAT if VAT-registered
- Ensure the practice's finance team is aware of the VAT component

### 10. Work Product and IP (Clause 1 + Clause 9)

On termination, Consultant must:
- Transfer all Work Product, Inventions, Proprietary Information
- Not retain any copies
- Return all proprietary information

This is standard but important - any financial models, processes, or tools Ronald creates belong to Dr James Laporta Inc.

### 11. Notice Details

| Party | Contact | Email | Phone |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| Clearshell (Ronald) | 37 Harley Street, Ferndale, Randburg | ronaldm@clearshell.co.za | 083 737 9891 |
| Dr James Laporta Inc | The Foundry, Suite 401, 74 Prestwich Street, De Waterkant | grantm@sanctura.co.uk | 021 205 0590 |

**Note:** The Dr James Laporta Inc contact email is Grant's (grantm@sanctura.co.uk), not James's. Confirm this is intentional - it means Grant is the primary contact for formal notices.
