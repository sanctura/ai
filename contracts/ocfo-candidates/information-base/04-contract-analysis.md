## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. No Clear Termination Clause

**Contract says:**
> "will remain effective until it is replaced by mutual agreement"

**Problems:**
- No explicit right to terminate for convenience
- No notice period stated
- No clarity on early exit for poor performance

**Request:**
- Mutual termination right with **30 days' notice**
- Immediate termination for cause (misconduct, non-performance, breach)

---

### 2. Scope Creep Risk ("Continuous Scoping")

**Contract says:**
> They can reassess scope based on transaction volume, complexity, and hours of support

**Problems:**
- Allows unilateral scope and fee pressure
- No hard caps defined
- No clear triggers for price increases

**Request:**
- Written agreement required before **any** scope or fee change
- Explicit confirmation that R110k/month is **fixed for 6 months**
- Clear KPI-based scope definition

---

### 3. Low Liability Cap

**Contract says:**
> Liability capped at fees paid in the **preceding 6 months**
> Excludes consequential loss and loss of profits

**Problems:**
- Very low protection for CFO-level advice
- Maximum exposure: R660,000

**Request:**
- Increase to **12 months of fees**, OR
- Explicit carve-out for **gross negligence or wilful misconduct**

---

### 4. Aggressive Non-Solicitation (24 Months)

**Contract says:**
> Cannot hire or contract with their staff for **24 months**
> Penalty: **240 hours × last billing rate**

**Problems:**
- 24 months is excessive
- Penalty is high and fixed (not loss-based)
- Blocks path to permanent hire

**Request:**
- Reduce to **12 months**
- Apply **only to Keith** (named CFO), not all OCFO personnel
- Cap penalty to **reasonable recruitment fee**

---

### 5. Vague Payment Terms

**Contract says:**
> References debit order, "100% of total retainer"

**Problems:**
- No payment date specified
- No invoice terms
- No linkage to actual service delivery

**Request:**
- Monthly invoicing **in arrears**
- Clear payment terms (e.g., **30 days from invoice**)
- Right to withhold payment for non-performance

---

### 6. Single-Person Dependency

**Contract says:**
> Service explicitly tied to Keith Harrod

**Problems:**
- No clause covering unavailability, resignation, or substitution
- If Keith leaves, contract continues but service stops

**Request:**
- Right to approve any replacement
- Fee reduction or termination right if Keith unavailable
- Minimum handover requirements

---

### 7. Inappropriate Inflation Clause

**Contract says:**
> CPI +2% to CPI +4% annual increases (from 1 March)

**Problems:**
- This is a 6-month fixed-term contract
- March falls within the contract period

**Request:**
- **Remove entirely** for this engagement

---

## Missing Clauses (Should Add)

| Clause | Standard For | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Clear deliverables | Senior financial roles | Missing |
| Performance standards/KPIs | All service contracts | Missing |
| Confidentiality survival | Post-termination | Missing |
| IP ownership | Work product | Missing |
| Governing law & jurisdiction | All contracts | Assumed SA, not explicit |

---

## Negotiation Summary (Ready to Use)

> We're comfortable with the commercial intent, but before acceptance we'd like to:
>
> 1. Add a 30-day mutual termination clause and immediate termination for cause
> 2. Confirm fees are fixed for the 6-month term with no scope changes without written approval
> 3. Adjust the non-solicitation period to 12 months and limit it to the named CFO
> 4. Clarify payment terms, invoicing, and service commencement date
> 5. Add protections relating to unavailability or substitution of the named CFO
> 6. Remove inflationary adjustments for this fixed-term engagement

## Interview vs Contract Discrepancy

| Topic | Interview Agreed | Contract States |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Duration** | 4 months | 6 months |
| **Probation** | 2-4 week exit clause | Not mentioned |
| **Extension** | Option to 6 months | Not mentioned |
| **Permanent hire** | Fee to negotiate | 24-month block + penalty |

**Action Required:** Contract needs amendment to reflect interview agreements.
