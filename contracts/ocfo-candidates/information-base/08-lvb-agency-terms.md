## Key Terms to Note

### Contract-to-Permanent Clause
> "Should a job assignment be given to LVB as a contract assignment with a view to going permanent, LVB will charge an appropriate fee for the contract assignment period. No guarantee applies. Once the position becomes permanent, the client will in addition, be liable for the full fee based on the annual cost to company package."

**Translation:** If Ronald starts on contract and goes permanent, you pay BOTH fees.

### 18-Month Restriction
> "The appropriate fee shall be charged and become payable... if any candidate introduced by LVB is engaged by the client... within an 18 (eighteen) month period after the introduction."

**Translation:** Can't hire Ronald directly for 18 months after introduction without paying fees.

### No Guarantee on Contract
Contract placements have **no guarantee period** - if Ronald leaves or is terminated, no refund/replacement.

### Payment Terms
- Invoiced on candidate's commencement
- Payment due within **14 days**
