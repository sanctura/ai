|--------|-----------|
| Ricardo's assessment | "Preferred - much more on the pulse" |
| Cash flow approach | 13-week rolling (more robust) |
| Team building | Detailed structure and hiring plan |
| Crisis experience | Business rescue, raised $10m+ |
| Engagement | More engaged in interview |

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ~~Negotiate terms with Lushia~~ | ~~Siraj~~ | Done |
| Negotiate with Ronald (travel, rate) | Siraj | **In progress** |
| Confirm total cost | Siraj | Pending |
| Confirm start date | Siraj | Pending |
| Notify OCFO (Keith) | Grant | After Ronald confirmed |
| Prepare for handover | Grant/Alida | Ongoing |

## Risk Note

Keith (OCFO) contract negotiation was in progress. Once Ronald is confirmed, need to communicate decision to OCFO.
