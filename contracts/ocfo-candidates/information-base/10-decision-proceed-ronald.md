## Negotiation History

### Round 1: Siraj ↔ Lushia (LVB) - 4 Feb

- LVB quoted R110,000/month + travel/accommodation on top
- We pushed back on travel being additional

### Round 2: Final Agreement

- Settled at R115,000/month all-in
- Ronald invoices as a company (handles own tax, claims own expenses)
- We only cover February return flight
- He covers all ongoing travel/accommodation from his rate

## Why Ronald Over Keith

| Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| Ricardo's assessment | "Preferred - much more on the pulse" |
| Cash flow approach | 13-week rolling (more robust) |
| Team building | Detailed structure and hiring plan |
| Crisis experience | Business rescue, raised $10m+ |
| Engagement | More engaged in interview |

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| ~~Negotiate terms with Lushia~~ | ~~Siraj~~ | Done |
| ~~Negotiate with Ronald (travel, rate)~~ | ~~Siraj~~ | **Done** |
| Receive and review contract | Siraj/Grant | **Pending** |
| Background checks completed | LVB | **Pending** |
| Sign contract | Grant/James | Pending |
| Confirm start date | Siraj | Pending |
| Notify OCFO (Keith) | Grant | After contract signed |
| Prepare for handover | Grant/Alida | Ongoing |

---

## Risk Note

- Keith (OCFO) contract negotiation was in progress - need to notify them once Ronald contract is signed
- Contract contingent on background checks passing (Ronald has confirmed all clear)
