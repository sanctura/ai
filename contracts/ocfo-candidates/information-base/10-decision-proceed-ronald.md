## Cost Summary (Confirmed - 8 Feb 2026)

| February return flight | Reimbursed (estimate ~R5,000-10,000) |
| **Total (excl flight)** | **R515,200** |

> Note: Siraaj's summary states R512,200 - R3,000 discrepancy to clarify.

## Negotiation History

### Round 1: Siraj ↔ Lushia (LVB) - 4 Feb

- LVB quoted R110,000/month + travel/accommodation on top
- We pushed back on travel being additional

### Round 2: Final Agreement

- Settled at R115,000/month all-in
- Ronald invoices as a company (handles own tax, claims own expenses)
- We only cover February return flight
- He covers all ongoing travel/accommodation from his rate

## Why Ronald Over Keith

| Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| Ricardo's assessment | "Preferred - much more on the pulse" |
| Cash flow approach | 13-week rolling (more robust) |
| Team building | Detailed structure and hiring plan |
| Crisis experience | Business rescue, raised $10m+ |
| Engagement | More engaged in interview |

## Risk Note

- Keith (OCFO) contract negotiation was in progress - need to notify them once Ronald contract is signed
- ~~Contract contingent on background checks passing~~ **Background checks passed - no concerns (confirmed 8 Feb)**
- **Scope of work must be established within the week** to make the agreement legally binding
- Ronald is not an employee - supervision must be outcome/deliverables-based, not probation-based
