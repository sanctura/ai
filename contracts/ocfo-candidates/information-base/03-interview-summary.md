## Key Decisions Made

### Aligned

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Contract length** | 4 months (not 3 or 6) |

| **Two-person structure** | Long-term need: CFO-level + bookkeeper |
| **Start recruitment** | Begin permanent CFO search while Keith engaged |
| **Audit timeline** | Must complete within 6 months of year-end |
| **Lexi bonus** | Gross up and put through payroll (not cash) |

### Needs Further Discussion

| Topic | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| **Real-time reporting** | How to automate; reduce manual Excel consolidation |
| **Contract details** | Probation exit clause, extension option, permanent hire fee |
| **OCFO fees** | Described as "exorbitant" - seek alternatives for permanent hire |

## Candidate Assessment Summary

### Ricardo Delgado's View
- Keith "could potentially do the job"
- Immediate availability is a major asset
- Janetta experience is valuable
- Appears hardworking

### Grant Merwitz's View
- Understands the landscape well enough to discuss automation
- Seeks 2-4 week probation exit clause as protection
- Concerned about OCFO commission structure

### Overall Conclusion
> "Since the hire is a contract through OCFO, proceed with a 3-4 month contract to pick up tasks and implement processes, with potential to have Keith help hire a bookkeeper."

## What Sanctura Needs (Discussed)

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Cash flow forecast** - Critical due to investment and funding tracking
2. **Real-time financial view** - Daily or weekly visibility vs monthly
3. **Handover from Alida** - Capture knowledge before 23 Feb departure

### Reporting Requirements
- Weekly KPIs
- Monthly management accounts
- Executive snapshot (currently manual Excel consolidation)
- 6-month and 12-month cash flow forecasts

### Automation Goals
- Reduce dependence on manual report pulling from Xero
- Enable anyone with ERP access to generate factual information
- Track weekly revenue against targets

---

## Keith's Proposed Approach

### First 30 Days
1. Understand revenue model
2. Review historical revenue data
3. Work with existing models from Grant/James
4. Establish weekly cash flow forecasting

### Cash Flow Methodology
- Weekly 30-day rolling forecast
- Estimate receipts from top 10 customers
- Personnel expenses predictable; revenue is tricky part
- Focus on tracking by week for early intervention

### Reporting Approach
> "Zero reports are straightforward to pull and convert to Excel. Anyone with access to the ERP could generate the necessary factual information."

## Contract Terms Discussed

| Term | Discussion |
|------|------------|
| **Duration** | 4 months (Keith's preference to avoid OCFO commission) |
| **Probation** | 2-4 week exit clause if unsatisfied (to negotiate) |
| **Extension** | Option to extend to 6 months (to negotiate) |
| **Permanent hire** | Typical recruitment fee 25-30% of annual wage |
| **Start date** | ASAP - ideally before Grant travels to London |
