---

## Decisions Made

### Aligned

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Candidate preferred** | Ronald over Keith - more engaged, better fit |
| **Contract term** | 6 months ideal (first 90 days = diagnosis) |
| **13-week cash flow** | Ronald will implement proactive forecast |
| **Hybrid role** | Hands-on initially, then strategic + team building |
| **Bookkeeper hire** | Within 2 weeks, part of Ronald's mandate |
| **Structure** | FM + 1 junior (AP/collections), leverage nurses for invoicing |

### Needs Negotiation

| Item | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Work arrangement** | Ronald proposed 2 weeks Cape Town / 2 weeks remote (Joburg). Grant doesn't like this. |
| **Rate** | R110k/month - potentially negotiate to R100k for longer contract |
| **Travel costs** | Unclear if R110k includes flights/accommodation from Joburg |
| **Agency fee** | 12% (~R60k for 4 months) - confirm exact terms |

## Ronald's Proposed Approach

### First 90 Days (Diagnosis)
1. Do hands-on work to learn "the entire story"
2. Meet with auditors immediately - they highlight problem areas fast
3. Identify gaps and develop job descriptions
4. Design and implement 13-week cash flow forecast
5. Hire bookkeeper/processor by month 2-3

### Cash Flow Methodology
- **13-week rolling forecast** (vs Keith's 30-day)
- Match financial commitments with inflows
- Proactively renegotiate supplier terms where necessary
- "Stop being reactive"

### Team Structure Proposed
```
Financial Manager (Ronald)
    ├── Junior 1: Payables + Collections
    └── Leverage: Nurses for invoicing (if performing adequately)
```
- Start with one junior, add second if volume requires
- Not a full CFO → FM → Bookkeeper structure (org too small)

## Key Quotes

On role scope:
> "I'm willing to get my hands dirty... doing the operational work in the first month allows me to learn the entire story."

On needing support:
> "Doing all the processing myself would not optimize the entire engine."

On approach:
> "The first step would be to design a proactive 13-week cash flow forecast... being prepared to renegotiate supplier terms where necessary."

On technical skills:
> "8-10 out of 10 for working with shared files and communication."

## Next Steps

1. **Grant to negotiate** with Ronald/Lushia on:
   - Work arrangement (prefer more on-site)
   - Rate and what it includes
   - Contract length (4 vs 6 months)
   - Agency fees

2. **Compare total costs:**
   - Keith (OCFO): R110k/month all-in = R440k for 4 months
   - Ronald (LVB): R110k + travel + 12% agency = TBD

3. **Decision point:** Once costs clear, choose between Keith and Ronald
