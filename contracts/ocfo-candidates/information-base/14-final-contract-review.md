**Accompanying email:** `updated-information/2023-02-11-MailFromSiraajAroundFinalContract.md`

## Siraaj's Email Summary

Siraaj confirms:
- He incorporated Grant's feedback from the Draft Two round
- He also gave the draft to **Ronald to review**, and Ronald requested two changes (which Siraaj was comfortable adding)
- He agrees the contract should go to Ronald for signature, then Grant countersigns

### Ronald's Two Requested Changes

| # | Ronald's Request | Where Applied |
|---|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Location flexibility** - Added "with flexibility in location as agreed with the Managing Director" | Clause 1 (Term and Termination) |
| 2 | **Invoice payment timeline** - Added "The invoice needs to be submitted by the 25th of the month for payment on the last working day" | Clause 3a (Monthly Rate) |

## Draft Two Issues: Resolution Status

| # | Issue from Draft Two Review | Priority | Status in vFinal |
|---|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | "Inc" remnants in Clauses 8a, 10, 11 | High | **FIXED** - All three instances removed |
| 2 | SOW content missing from Annexure A | Critical | **STILL MISSING** - See below |
| 3 | US legal terminology (Clauses 4, 12) | Low | **FIXED** - Changed to SA equivalents |
| 4 | Typo "Stret" in Notices | Low | **FIXED** - Now reads "Street" |
| 5 | "Minimum 40 hours" language in Clause 3a | Medium | **FIXED** - Now reads "full-time basis (40 hours per week)" |
| 6 | Finance email (accounts@drjameslaportainclife.com) | Low | **FIXED** - Changed to accounts@sancturalife.com |

### Bonus Fix
- **Clause 8.4** arbitration cross-reference corrected from "Clause 20.c" to "Clause 16.c"

## Remaining Issue: Statement of Work Content

**Priority: CRITICAL**

The SOW (Annexure A) is still a cover page only. The header fields are correct:
- Job Title: Fractional Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- Reports To: Grant Merwitz (Managing Director)
- Consultant: Clearshell Management Solutions (Pty) Ltd

But **the actual scope, deliverables, phases, responsibilities, payment controls, review schedule, and out-of-scope items from Grant's SOW (`output/sow-ronald-mushonga.md`) are not included.**

This was the single most critical issue in both the Draft One and Draft Two reviews. Without the SOW content:
- The contract has no defined scope of work
- Invoice approval has nothing to measure against (Clause 3b references "requirements of the SOW attached")
- The engagement has no measurable deliverables or performance framework

**This must be resolved before signing.**

## Assessment of Ronald's Changes

Both changes Ronald requested are reasonable and low-risk:

### 1. Location Flexibility (Clause 1)
> "...with flexibility in location as agreed with the Managing Director"

**Assessment: Acceptable.** This aligns with the reality of the engagement - Ronald is Joburg-based and will need to work remotely for portions of the contract. The flexibility is qualified by "as agreed with the Managing Director", which preserves Grant's control. This is sensible wording.

### 2. Invoice Payment Timeline (Clause 3a)
> "The invoice needs to be submitted by the 25th of the month for payment on the last working day."

**Assessment: Acceptable.** This gives both parties certainty:
- Ronald knows when to submit (by the 25th)
- Ronald knows when to expect payment (last working day of the month)
- Saint Raphael has a clear payment obligation timeline

This is standard practice and protects both parties. Note: the original Draft Two had no invoice submission deadline or payment timeline, so this actually tightens up a gap.

## What's Now Good in the Contract

- Contracting entity: Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd throughout (no remnants)
- Extension clause present (mutual written agreement)
- Flat monthly billing at R115,000 ex VAT (no hourly/timesheet requirements)
- February pro-rata provision included
- Contact details: grantm@sanctura.co.uk and accounts@sancturalife.com
- SA governing law and terminology throughout
- Location flexibility with MD approval
- Clear invoicing timeline (25th for last-working-day payment)
- All "Inc" artifacts removed
- Correct arbitration cross-reference

## Resolution

**Status: READY TO SIGN**

Grant confirmed (12 February 2026) that the SOW (`output/sow-ronald-mushonga.md`) will be attached alongside the contract as Annexure A. This resolves the final outstanding issue.

All items from Draft One, Draft Two, and vFinal reviews are now addressed. Contract proceeds to Ronald for signature, then Grant countersigns.
