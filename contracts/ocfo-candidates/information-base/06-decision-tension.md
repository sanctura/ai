# Decision Tension & Alternative Options

**Date:** 3 February 2026
**Status:** Unresolved - time critical

---

## The Disagreement

| Stakeholder | Position | Concern |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **James (CEO)** | Explore alternatives before committing | Not sure Keith is the right personality fit |
| **Grant (MD)** | Proceed with Keith now | Time pressure - can't afford delays |

---

## Time Constraints

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Alida's last day | 23 February 2026 |
| Days remaining | ~20 days |
| Grant traveling | Monday (to London) |
| Knowledge transfer window | Closing rapidly |

---

## Alternatives Being Explored

### 1. Bokkelman (Audit Consultancy)
- **Status:** James reaching out
- **Idea:** Could they provide a bookkeeper (2 days/week) or short-term senior resource?
- **Risk:** Unknown availability, capability, timeline

### 2. James's Network
- **Status:** James reaching out to friends/colleagues
- **Risk:** Speculative, no leads yet

### 3. Grant's Contact
- **Status:** Called - available **1 April** (too late)
- **Outcome:** Proves how hard interim resources are to find

### 4. Part-Time Bookkeeper Model
- **Idea:** 2 days/week from a consultancy
- **Problem:** Doesn't address CFO-level oversight, compliance, reporting

---

## Reality Check

| Challenge | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Market is tight | Contact only available 1 April |
| Time is critical | 20 days until Alida leaves |
| Handover needs overlap | Keith could start shadowing immediately |
| Alternatives unproven | No concrete leads yet |

---

## Grant's Proposed Path Forward

> "Get Keith in now, commit to four months, work toward a better plan in four months giving us time to interview candidates and build what we want."

### Rationale
1. Keith has the skills for a 4-month bridge
2. R110k/month is expensive but buys time
3. 4 months allows proper permanent CFO search
4. Alternatives are speculative with no timeline
5. Waiting risks losing the handover window entirely

### What This Buys
- Immediate coverage during Alida's final weeks
- Time to find the right long-term solution
- Reduced pressure on Grant/James
- Compliance continuity

---

## Cost of Delay

| If we wait... | Consequence |
|---------------|-------------|
| 1 week | Alida's handover window shrinks to ~13 days |
| 2 weeks | Minimal overlap, knowledge lost |
| Until 1 April | No coverage for 5+ weeks, compliance risk |

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] What specifically concerns James about Keith's personality?
- [ ] What response from Bokkelman (if any)?
- [ ] Any leads from James's network?
- [ ] Is 2 days/week bookkeeper sufficient? (Likely no)

---

## Decision Needed

**By when:** Before Grant travels Monday

**Options:**
1. **Proceed with Keith** - Sign contract (with amendments), start immediately
2. **Delay for alternatives** - Risk handover window, hope for better option
3. **Hybrid** - Start Keith while continuing search (expensive if we exit early)

---

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Get Bokkelman response | James | ASAP |
| Assess any network leads | James | Friday |
| Final decision on Keith | James + Grant | Before Monday travel |
| If proceeding: Send contract amendments to OCFO | Grant | Same day as decision |
