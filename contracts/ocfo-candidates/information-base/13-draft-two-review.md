## Issues Requiring Action

### Issue 1: "Inc" Remnants (Search-and-Replace Error)

**Priority: HIGH** - Makes the contract reference a non-existent entity.

Three places still say "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd **Inc**" — an artifact from the original template where the company name was followed by "Inc":

| Location | Current Text |
|----------|-------------|
| Clause 8a | "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd **Inc** may at any time..." |
| Clause 10 heading | "Hiring Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd **Inc** Employees" |
| Clause 11 | "Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd **Inc's** stop-work order" |

**Action:** Remove "Inc" from all three instances.

### Issue 2: Statement of Work Content is Missing

**Priority: CRITICAL** - The SOW is the backbone of the engagement.

Annexure A in Draft Two is a cover page only — it has the header fields:
- Job Title: Fractional Chief Financial Officer (CFO) ✅
- Reports To: Grant Merwitz (Managing Director) ✅
- Consultant: Clearshell Management Solutions (Pty) Ltd ✅

But **none of the actual scope content** from Grant's SOW has been included. The following are all missing:
- Scope of engagement
- Phased deliverables (Phase 1-3)
- Ongoing responsibilities
- Payment controls
- Review schedule
- Out of scope items

**Action:** Siraaj must incorporate the full SOW content that Grant attached to his email. Without it, the contract has no defined scope and invoice approval has nothing to measure against.

### Issue 3: US Legal Terminology

**Priority: LOW** - Cosmetic but looks unprofessional in a South African contract.

| Location | Current Text | Should Be |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Clause 4 | "all applicable federal, state, local and other taxes" | "all applicable taxes" (or "taxes as required by South African law") |
| Clause 12 | "all applicable federal and state civil rights and nondiscrimination laws, rules, and executive orders" | "all applicable South African employment and non-discrimination laws" |

These are template artifacts from a US-origin agreement. They don't create legal risk but are sloppy.

### Issue 4: Typo in Notices (Clause 16.9)

**Priority: LOW**

Ronald's address reads "37 Harley **Stret**" — should be "37 Harley **Street**".

### Issue 5: Clause 3a - "Minimum 40 Hours" Language

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Tension between hourly language and flat rate billing.

Clause 3a reads:
> "Consultant shall submit invoice(s) to Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd for a **minimum 40 hours per week**, which equates to standard monthly fee of ZAR R115 000.00 (ex VAT) per month"

The "minimum 40 hours per week" language is awkward alongside flat rate billing. It could be read to mean:
- 40 hours is the *minimum* — could Ronald argue for extra billing if he works more?
- Or that the flat rate *assumes* 40 hours — which is fine

Suggest rewording to: "Consultant shall provide services on a full-time basis (40 hours per week) for a standard monthly fee of ZAR R115,000.00 (ex VAT) per month."

### Issue 6: Finance Department Email

**Priority: LOW** - May be intentional.

Clause 4 still references **accounts@drjameslaportainclife.com** as the email for invoice submission. Since the contracting entity is now Saint Raphael, confirm whether this is still the correct accounts email or if it should change.

## What's Good in Draft Two

- Contracting entity correctly changed to Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd in most places
- Extension clause added as requested
- Invoicing changed to flat monthly billing with February pro-rata
- Contact details updated to Grant
- SOW header fields populated correctly
- February pro-rata provision added in Clause 3c
