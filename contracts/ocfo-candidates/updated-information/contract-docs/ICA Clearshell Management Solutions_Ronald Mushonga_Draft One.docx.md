1. The Parties agree that, due to the nature of this Agreement, Dr James Laporta Inc will not be liable to pay the Independent Consultant any Employee Benefits (i.e., medical, dental, vision, vacation, sick leave, accommodation travel or any other costs incurred unless mutually agreed.). 

6. **Relationship of Parties.** 

When performing any services under this agreement, the consultant will be an independent contractor and not an employee of Dr James Laporta Inc. Dr James Laporta Inc is not undertaking, by virtue of this Agreement, any responsibility for supervising, controlling, or directing the conduct of the Consultant’s obligations, and the Consultant shall exercise the Consultant’s own professional judgment and shall control the manner by which Services are performed, subject only to the terms and standards of this Agreement. The Consultant, the Consultant’s employees and the Consultant’s agents, if any, have no authority to bind Dr James Laporta Inc by contract or otherwise.

7. **Standards of Performance.** 

The Consultant shall professionally perform the Services, in accordance with the appropriate industry standards and shall comply with all provisions of confidentiality, privacy, and security as may be required in support of the Services (e.g., project-specific confidentiality agreements, privacy laws, and any other project-specific compliance requirements).

8. **Changes.** 

1. Dr James Laporta Inc may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the Consultant, make changes within the general scope of this Agreement in any one or more of the following:

   1) Description of services to be performed.  
   2) Time of performance (*i.e.,* hours of the day, days of the week, etc.).  
   3) Place of performance of the services.  
   4) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for Dr James Laporta Inc in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications.  
   5) Method of shipment or packing of supplies.  
   6) Place of delivery.  
   7) Amount of Dr James Laporta Inc-furnished property.

2. If any change causes an increase or decrease, in Dr James Laporta Inc’s discretion, in any of the maximum budget or the time required for performance of any part of the work under this Agreement, whether or not changed by the order, or otherwise affects any other terms and

   

3.  conditions of this Agreement, Dr James Laporta Inc may make an adjustment in any one or more of the following and will modify the Agreement accordingly:

   1) Maximum budget.  
   2) Delivery schedule.  
   3) Other affected terms.

4. The Consultant shall assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 15 days from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if Dr James Laporta Inc decides that the facts justify it, Dr James Laporta Inc may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the contract. 

5. Failure to agree to any adjustment will be a dispute and shall be handled in accordance with Clause 20.c. Arbitration, of this agreement. However, nothing in this clause excuses the Consultant from proceeding with the Agreement as changed.

6. This Agreement may not be modified unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

9. ## Proprietary Information.

1. The parties agree that any information of a proprietary and/or confidential nature, including trade secrets, from Dr James Laporta Inc and/or its clients ("Proprietary Information") disclosed under this Agreement, derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means, by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.

2. All rights, title and interest in Proprietary Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement are reserved by Dr James Laporta Inc or its clients, as the case may be, and the Consultant will not use such Proprietary Information disclosed to it under this Agreement to benefit itself or others, except for the purposes for which the Proprietary Information is disclosed as may be stated herein.

3. The Consultant will not disclose such Proprietary Information to any third party unless and until expressly authorized in writing to do so by Dr James Laporta Inc or its clients, as the case may be, except to the extent that such disclosure shall be required by law. When disclosure is required by law, such disclosure shall be made only after the Consultant has notified Dr James Laporta Inc in writing and Dr James Laporta Inc or its clients, as the case may be, has an opportunity to take appropriate action to protect its legal interest in the Proprietary Information.

4. If only a portion of any Proprietary Information falls within any one of the exceptions listed in this section above, the remainder shall continue to be subject to this Agreement.

5. The Consultant shall limit dissemination of Proprietary Information to those of its employees who have a need to know such information to fulfill the purpose of this Agreement, provided that such employees have executed a nondisclosure agreement the provisions of which are consistent with this Agreement.

6. The Consultant acknowledges that Dr James Laporta Inc, due to the unique and sensitive nature of the Proprietary Information, would suffer irreparable harm in the event of a breach of the Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement, in that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate Dr James Laporta Inc for such a breach. The parties agree that in such circumstances, Dr James Laporta Inc shall be entitled, in addition to monetary relief, to injunctive relief as may be necessary to restrain any continuing or further breach by the Consultant, without showing or proving any actual damages sustained by Dr James Laporta Inc.

7. The Consultant shall return all Proprietary Information and any copies thereof to Dr James Laporta Inc at the time this Agreement expires, or earlier at the initiation of the Consultant or upon the Consultant's receipt of a written request from Dr James Laporta Inc for the return of such Proprietary Information.

10. **Hiring Dr James Laporta Inc Employees.** 

The Consultant shall not knowingly solicit, recruit, hire or otherwise employ or retain any employee of Dr James Laporta Inc, performing under this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement and for one (1) year following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Dr James Laporta Inc. This section shall not restrict in any way the rights of the Consultant to solicit or recruit generally in the media and shall not prohibit the Consultant from hiring an employee of Dr James Laporta Inc who answers any advertisement or who otherwise voluntarily applies for this without having been personally solicited or recruited by the Consultant.

11. **Stop Work.** 

Upon receiving notification from the client to stop work on a project in which the Consultant is engaged, Dr James Laporta Inc may suspend all or any portion of the Services which the Consultant had agreed to perform for said client, from the notification point forward. The Consultant shall receive such notification to stop work in writing. The Consultant shall stop all such Services immediately upon receipt of Dr James Laporta Inc’s stop- work order and shall promptly resume the Services only after written receipt of direction from Dr James Laporta Inc to resume work.

12. **Equal Opportunity/Non-Discrimination**. 

The Consultant shall not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, religion, political affiliation, national origin, sex, age or physical or mental disability. The Consultant shall ensure that applicants are fairly considered, and that employees are treated without regard to their race, creed, color, religion, political affiliation, national origin, sex, age, or physical or mental disability, except to where age or disability relates to a bona fide occupational qualification. Such action shall include, but is not limited to, employment, promotion, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation (including benefits), and selection for training. The Consultant shall comply with all applicable federal and state civil rights and nondiscrimination laws, rules, and executive orders. This Agreement may be suspended or terminated, in whole or in part, in the event of the Consultant’s non-compliance with this clause, and the Consultant may be declared ineligible for further contracts with Dr James Laporta Inc.

13. **Indemnification.** 

Neither Dr James Laporta Inc nor its affiliates, nor any Client shall be responsible for, and the Consultant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dr James Laporta Inc, its affiliates, and each Client and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents from, and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and expenses (collectively “Dr James Laporta Inc Losses”), joint or several, resulting or arising from any third-party claims, actions, proceedings, investigations or litigation relating to or arising from or in connection with this Agreement, or the Services contemplated herein, that result from the Consultant’s breach of this Agreement.

14. **Publications.** 

The Consultant will not publish anything based on work the Consultant performed under this Agreement without prior explicit written approval from Dr James Laporta Inc, and the opportunity for Dr James Laporta Inc to review the proposed submission prior to publication, and acknowledgement of Dr James Laporta Inc in the published piece.

15. **Communications with Client**. 

Consultant shall not communicate directly with or take direction from any of Dr James Laporta Inc’s clients relating to the Services defined in this Agreement, unless expressly authorized to do so by Dr James Laporta Inc.

16. ## General.

1. **Waiver**. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any similar subsequent breach or any breach of any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any provision in this Agreement shall be effective unless made in a writing signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced.

2. **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be construed, governed, interpreted, and applied in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa.  The failure to enforce any right or provision herein shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. If any provisions herein are found to be unenforceable because they are overly broad or in conflict with applicable laws, the parties intend that such provisions be replaced, reformed or narrowed so that their original business purpose can be accomplished to the extent permitted by law, and that the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

3. **Arbitration**. The Parties shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute that may arise under this Agreement through good faith negotiations. If the Parties are unable to settle, the parties agree that the dispute shall be submitted to and decided by arbitration in the Republic of South Africa and shall be heard by an arbitrator to be agreed between the Parties, failing which one shall be nominated by the President of the Law Society. The arbitration shall commence within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator 

   

   shall be final and binding and may at the request of either of the Parties be made an Order of Court, in a Court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include an order on legal costs.

4. **Complete Agreement**. Both parties acknowledge that they have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms. This Agreement, including any attachments hereto, is the complete understanding between the Consultant and Dr James Laporta Inc and it supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, representations and understanding concerning the subject matter set forth herein.

5. **Assignment**. This Agreement is specific to the parties hereto, and neither party may assign or transfer its interest without prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to do so shall be deemed void.

6. **Modification**. This Agreement may not be modified unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

7. **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and, to the extent possible, this Agreement shall continue without effect to the remaining provisions.

8. **Drafting Party**. Each party agrees that questions of interpretation shall not be re-solved by any rule of interpretation providing for interpretation against the drafting party. This Agreement shall be construed as though drafted by both parties

   

9. **Notices**. Any notice given by either party to the other party shall be in writing. All notices will be sent to the following addresses, which addresses may be changed upon written notice to the other party:
