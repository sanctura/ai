Hi Grant

 

Thank you for your feedback and for making those changes. In addition to your feedback, I have asked Ronald to review the draft and provide his feedback. He requested the following updates, which I was comfortable adding

 

Clause 1: Term and Termination.
Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd hereby retains the Consultant, and the Consultant agrees to perform professional services at 40 hours a week, with flexibility in location as agreed with the Managing Director
 

Clause 3 Invoices.
Monthly Rate.  Consultant shall submit invoice(s) to Saint Raphael (Pty) Ltd for a full-time basis (40 hours per week), which equates to a standard monthly fee of ZAR R115 000.00 (ex VAT) per month (“Contract Rate”).  The invoice needs to be submitted by the 25th of the month for payment on the last working day.
 

I have incorporated my updates in the final version attached. I agree with sending it to Ronald to attach his signature, then you can countersign.

 

Regards
