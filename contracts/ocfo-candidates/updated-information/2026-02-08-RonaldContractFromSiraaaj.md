Dear Grant

 

I have attached draft one of the Independent Consultant Agreement for your review. Please specifically also look at the sections highlighted in yellow. I can confirm that all the feedback received came back with no concerns.

**Next steps**

* Review the agreement and send it to OptiWorX to complete with Ronald for signature  
* Ronald will commence work at the practice on Tuesday, 10 February 2026, where he will meet up with Kyle and Alida.  
* Ronald will attend to all costs excluding the initial first flight in and out, where we will be reimbursed by the Practice

 

**Contract Term Requirements**

* Ensure we have Ronald sign and execute the full agreement.  
* Grant to establish a clear scope of work with clear outcomes within the week to ensure it is a legally binding agreement.  
* Grant to set up clear review feedback sessions with Ronald over the course of the agreement.  
* Invoices to be submitted to the Practice and paid by the last working day of each month by the finance department. The February invoice should be pro rata.

 

**Supervision & Management**

* Ronald is not legally considered an employee; therefore, no mention of probation review, but instead a deliverables outcome-based review  
* Any barriers need to be formally communicated, and Ronald provides formal feedback.

 

I have also attached other legal documents for our record.

 

Let me know if you have any other questions
