NEEDS FURTHER DISCUSSION

**Hire Bookkeeper/Processor Support**

New financial manager must help hire bookkeeper/processor within next two weeks to handle administrative processing. Manager proposed starting with one junior staff focusing on payables and collections, deferring Accounts Receivable support if nurses invoicing remains adequate.

**Candidate Preference Ronald Mushonga**

Ronald Mushonga candidate preferred over Keith for role; candidate appears more engaged and suitable for position.

**Define Candidate Contract Length**

Contract length for Ronald Mushonga candidate needs determination, considering options like four or six months, and inclusion of flexibility elements like probation periods or stop clauses.

**Determine Candidate Travel Costing**

Candidate's total costing needs to be determined, specifically if company must cover trips, flights, and accommodation for candidate living in Joberg to work in Cape Town.

**Negotiate Candidate Monthly Rate**

Negotiate candidate's price, potentially reducing the monthly rate from 110 to 100 in exchange for a longer contract length.

**Negotiate Candidate Remote Work Schedule**

Need to negotiate working arrangement with candidate regarding two weeks local and two weeks remote work arrangement, as Grant is unsure if setup will work.

**Negotiate Candidate Terms Agency Fees**

Grant will negotiate finer terms with candidate regarding the 110 fee, including if it covers travel, and clarify exact agency commission/fees associated with candidate's contract.

DISAGREEMENTS

**Need Financial Manager Role**

Organization needs Financial Manager, not junior Accountant or bookkeeper, due to consolidation and group structure requirements. Group is not large enough for CFO leading financial manager and bookkeeper structure.

**Scope of Financial Manager Role**

Group proposed incoming financial leader must perform hands-on Financial Manager role to stabilize systems before focusing on strategy. Candidate stated need for junior processor for operational tasks to maximize senior role effectiveness and avoid processing bottlenecks.

ALIGNED

**Set Financial Manager Contract Term**

New financial manager contract should ideally span six months for effective diagnosis and results measurement. First 90 days focused on diagnosis and finding operational issues.

**Implement 13-Week Cash Flow Forecast**

Financial manager must design and implement 13-week operating cash flow forecast upon arrival. This helps understand customer and creditor terms for proactive financial management.

SHELVED

**Fill Vacant Financial Manager Position**

Organization sought to fill vacant Financial Manager position temporarily and eventually find permanent replacement. Prior manager struggled transitioning from small single clinic accounting to wider group financial management.

*More details:*

* **Introductions and Business Context** The meeting began with introductions, where Ricardo Delgado, CFO for Capricorn Capital, and Andrew introduced themselves as representatives of the investment company on the Sanctura board, along with original founder Dr James Laporta and CEO Grant Merwitz ([00:01:46](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.kgoyyssyezyo)). Ricardo Delgado explained that Sanctura has grown from a single clinic in Cape Town to a multi-site operation with a holding company and an additional clinic in London that has been operational since May of last year ([00:03:54](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.r9ug2julnj0q)). The immediate need is to temporarily fill a vacant Financial Manager position, ideally finding a permanent solution as the previous financial manager struggled to transition from a single-clinic accountant role to a manager for a wider, though still small, group with multi-revenue streams across countries ([00:02:45](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.zewrzc1mm7ox)).

* **Ronald Mushonga's Professional Background** Ronald Mushonga, a Chartered Accountant for over 15 years, detailed his experience starting with Huge Telecom, a listed company, where he was immediately "thrown right into the deep end" to pick up pieces, restructure accounts, and quickly manage consolidation for a group of accounts ([00:05:07](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.wwql6jyxl3nc)). They spent about eight years there, focusing on putting controls in place and leading mergers and acquisitions ([00:06:15](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.wrv3ig49lo7)). Ronald Mushonga's departure from Huge Telecom was related to a restructuring that brought in a founder of MTN as a financial director, which led to a beneficial parting agreement for them ([00:07:10](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.3akv6k3py0u2)).

* **Subsequent Experience and Fractional CFO Work** Ronald Mushonga then moved to Air Shifts, a state-owned enterprise, where they headed finance during a business rescue, dealing with procurement issues and raising money from the department of public enterprise ([00:08:06](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.5b2oh9vonq9g)). Since leaving Air Shifts after three and a half years, Ronald Mushonga has been working as a fractional CFO on various engagements, including a recent 12-month contract in Zambia to raise $10 million for renewable energy products, build a finance team, and implement governance and systems ([00:09:21](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.by5lgd9gj0nt)) ([00:24:02](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.kwuxfih3ecoy)). They successfully achieved this mandate by September of the previous year, training a local financial manager to take over ([00:10:34](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.491wjkl7ok82)).

* **Role of the CFO as a Business Advisor** Ronald Mushonga described their role as often being more of a business advisor than just a financial manager, seeing the entire organization and patching gaps between operations and sales, which often operate in silos. They emphasized that the CEO should focus on sales and growth while the CFO focuses on increasing the company's financial clarity and structure ([00:12:33](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.bpuy004oqj1u)). Furthermore, they mentioned being very good at communicating effectively at both the board level with investors and regulators, and the ground level with frontline staff using simpler language ([00:11:35](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.9jgeesuia5ly)).

* **Hybrid Role Discussion** The discussion turned to the nature of the immediate role, which Ricardo Delgado suggested would be a hybrid of high-level strategic work and "mundane capturing data reconciliations" ([00:13:28](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.tmhavwcsjhct)). Ronald Mushonga agreed that this is an important distinction and that while they are willing to "get their hands dirty," the ideal approach would be to simultaneously train a future financial manager or strong accountant to eventually handle the operational aspects ([00:14:25](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.wsopxjxkhvar)). They noted that doing the operational work in the first month allows them to learn the entire story, which makes training and imparting knowledge easier ([00:15:25](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.d254ney0xncr)).

* **Staffing Structure and Recruitment** Ricardo Delgado shared that the incumbent financial manager was unable to hire a bookkeeper to assist them despite having a budget since last April ([00:16:28](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.hpqh42c4x6f4)). Ronald Mushonga advised that the company needs a financial manager, not just an accountant, due to the need for consolidation principles across multiple companies ([00:17:38](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.jm7vy3eusy0u)). They proposed a starting structure of a Financial Manager overseeing Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable, possibly starting with two positions and leveraging existing staff like nurses for invoicing initially ([00:18:30](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.cbpene5cuy5j)). Ronald Mushonga suggested they would focus the first month on diagnosis, identifying gaps, and developing a job description to assist in recruitment, aiming to have someone hired by month two or three ([00:26:14](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.no3xh1tsck27)).

* **Contract Duration and Availability** Ronald Mushonga stated that while they were told the contract was for about four months, a six-month term would be ideal to effectively see realistic results, as the first 90 days are typically for diagnosis ([00:28:22](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.us8kvb9sjk55)). Ronald Mushonga confirmed their immediate availability and flexibility to travel, being based in Johannesburg ([00:24:02](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.kwuxfih3ecoy)) ([00:40:54](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.54y0068lqp1d)).

* **The Practical Needs of the Financial Manager Role** Dr James Laporta, the CEO, joined the meeting and emphasized the urgency of filling the Financial Manager role to stabilize rapidly growing clinics ([00:21:18](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.ctuecj38ljwz)) ([00:29:09](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.jso7ebm679k)). Dr James Laporta asked Ronald Mushonga directly if they would be happy performing a "hands-on" Financial Manager role, even if it is below their capability, to plug holes and ensure systems are working before focusing on strategy ([00:22:09](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.8ih3dpadb42p)) ([00:29:51](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.bu20jx4i1qbj)). Ronald Mushonga reiterated that they would need a processor or bookkeeper to monitor, as doing all the processing themself would not optimize the "entire engine" ([00:30:51](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.wgvld33n5koh)).

* **Hiring a Bookkeeper to Support the Financial Manager** Grant Merwitz and Ricardo Delgado confirmed that the plan is to hire an administrative bookkeeper or "processor" to support the senior finance role, as this is easier to place than a financial manager ([00:32:45](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.shyq1w831l2e)). Ricardo Delgado clarified that they view the ideal structure as a senior person (CFO or Financial Manager) setting up processes and controls and a junior person (bookkeeper) for administrative processing ([00:33:36](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.clq394yfjpjd)). Ricardo Delgado stressed that a mandate for the incoming fractional CFO would be to assist Grant Merwitz in hiring that bookkeeper within the next two weeks ([00:34:26](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.ylqftltpk4hj)).

* **Optimizing Existing Staff Capacity** Ronald Mushonga argued for starting with one person focused on payables and collections, leveraging the nurses for invoicing if their performance is adequate, with the goal of bringing in a second person for a specific function later if volume increases ([00:36:31](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.84wyrfw7a6h)). Dr James Laporta provided encouraging insight, confirming that capacity exists within the practice manager and nurses, making it feasible to start with a hybrid model where a two-level person makes it work, optimizing existing staff capacity rather than immediately imposing an ideal accounting structure ([00:37:22](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.boheqctyphcj)).

* **Technical Adaptability and Cash Flow Management** Grant Merwitz asked about Ronald Mushonga's technical adaptability, particularly with cloud services and asynchronous work, to which Ronald Mushonga rated themself 8-10 out of 10 for working with shared files and communication ([00:42:47](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.7hhdb16cexga)). Regarding the reactive cash flow management of the clinics, Ronald Mushonga stated their first step would be to design a proactive 13-week cash flow forecast, matching financial commitments with inflows, and being prepared to renegotiate supplier terms where necessary ([00:44:44](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.wxxk1nvcb370)).

* **Current Financial Status and Auditing** In response to Ronald Mushonga's questions, Ricardo Delgado confirmed that tax payments are up to date ([00:48:47](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.6abfj5k8oc2y)). The company had its last audited financials in February 2025, with one minor bank account matter pending before sign-off ([00:49:34](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.vp5kaq2bezd1)). Ronald Mushonga stated that meeting with the auditors would be a priority at the start, as they can quickly highlight problem areas ([00:50:26](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.26d3yoq8u9cu)). Grant Merwitz noted that the outgoing financial manager believed everything for the year-end close was in order, but the general view was that the role had become "too much too fast" for them ([00:51:16](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.45m36pv7i35x)).

* **Company Size and Structure** Grant Merwitz confirmed the staff count is about 20, including doctors and nurses, with a very low number of office staff ([00:53:42](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.7kjbmom5ft5v)). The three operating entities include a private company and an Inc. (for medical procedures in the doctor's name) in South Africa, and one limited company in the UK. Ricardo Delgado clarified there are effectively three operating entities where assistance is needed, along with a UK holding company that sits outside of the fractional CFO's remit ([00:54:30](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.obajjta2o3e0)).

* **Growth Vision** The final question concerned the company's growth vision. Ricardo Delgado explained that they see the business as a multi-clinic site with opportunities to introduce different revenue streams and products, like radiation bunkers. The immediate goal is to stabilize and grow the two existing clinics organically, after which they will decide whether to pursue additional clinics or add services to the current ones, requiring the Financial Manager/CFO to perform return analysis ([00:56:13](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.p20t6egsp1s1)).

* **Business Growth Strategy and Transition** Ronald Mushonga and Ricardo Delgado discussed the next six months focusing on growing existing clinics, followed by expansion through new clinics or services, while acknowledging the need to learn new markets and navigate the regulatory framework and licensing. Ricardo Delgado ended their call with Ronald Mushonga to speak with Grant Merwitz ([00:58:05](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.hstz5cpxfzwy)).

* **Candidate Evaluation and Contract Negotiation** Ricardo Delgado expressed that they preferred the candidate to Keith, believing the candidate is "much more on the pulse" and capable of doing the job better. Ricardo Delgado raised three key considerations for the candidate: the contract length (four or six months with flexibility/probation periods), the costing, particularly if the candidate is in Joberg and expects travel expenses to Cape Town, and potential flexibility in the price, possibly by reducing the monthly rate for a longer contract ([00:59:00](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.a36pi3l7ghfq)). Grant Merwitz disliked the proposal of the candidate being remote for two weeks and in the office for two weeks and committed to negotiating this with them ([00:59:45](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.pszlqqfve0gz)).

* **Cost and Agency Commission Details** Grant Merwitz noted that the agent takes a commission, which is around 12% monthly for a contract placement, adding to the cost of 110 (presumably R110k), which they mentioned was included in the summary. Ricardo Delgado thought the fee was a fixed amount or 60k, but Grant Merwitz confirmed they needed to revisit the details, acknowledging the separate payment to the agent factors into the total cost. Grant Merwitz also stated that the 110 fee is negotiable, but they need to negotiate the finer terms, including whether travel is included ([01:00:31](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.a211qnbw9y7c)).

* **Next Steps and Salary Information** Grant Merwitz indicated the urgency to determine the candidate's cost to decide between going with the OCFO or this candidate. Ricardo Delgado requested Grant Merwitz to get an idea of the cost of a leader. Grant Merwitz confirmed that they had asked for a remuneration view that morning because they needed the current salaries to propose a salary increase for a staff member ([01:00:31](?tab=t.yu4fftlfwz9a#heading=h.a211qnbw9y7c)).

### Suggested next steps
