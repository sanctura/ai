# How to Use the Weekly Planning Template

## Each Week Setup (10-15 minutes)

### 1. Copy the Template
- Copy `planning/weekly-template.md` to `planning/current-week.md`
- Or if using version control: `cp planning/weekly-template.md planning/current-week.md`

### 2. Fill in Header Info
- Update **Week Of** dates (Monday to Sunday)
- Add **Week Number** (1-52 of the year)
- Add **Cycle Week** (1, 2, 3, or 4) - important for alternating meetings!

### 3. Set Your Top 3 Priorities
Ask yourself:
- What are the most important outcomes this week?
- What will move the needle on strategic goals?
- What's blocking progress that needs to be cleared?

Fill in:
- What the priority is
- Why it's critical right now
- What success looks like (concrete, measurable)

### 4. Prep Meeting Agendas
For each 1:1, prepare:
- 2-3 topics you need to cover
- Questions you need answered
- Decisions that need to be made

**Have direct reports send their agenda items 24h before**

### 5. Plan Deep Work Blocks
For each deep work block, note:
- What you'll work on
- What you want to accomplish
- Any prep needed

## During the Week

## Friday Review (30-45 minutes)

### Complete Week-End Review Section
1. **Accomplished**: What got done (celebrate this!)
2. **Not Completed**: What didn't happen (why?)
3. **Rolled to Next Week**: What's carrying forward
4. **Key Learnings**: What did you learn about the business, team, or yourself?
5. **Adjustments Needed**: What to change in next week's plan

### Time Allocation Check
Roughly estimate hours spent on:
- MD work (meetings + deep work)
- CTO work (meetings + deep work)
- Innovation time

Ask: Was I close to 60/30/10? If not, what pulled me off track?

### Archive the Week
- Move `planning/current-week.md` to `planning/archive/week-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Use the Monday date of that week

## Tips for Success

1. **Protect Deep Work**: Only true emergencies interrupt these blocks
2. **Batch Similar Work**: Use Monday for all financial/ops reviews, Tuesday for technical work
3. **Keep Innovation Free**: Wednesday morning has NO calendar - let it be unstructured
4. **Time-box Everything**: Start and end meetings on time
5. **Capture Immediately**: Don't rely on memory - note actions during meetings
6. **Review Weekly**: The Friday review is critical - don't skip it
7. **Adjust as Needed**: If the pattern isn't working, change it

## When Things Change

### Someone Needs to Reschedule
- Use Friday flex time as primary reschedule slot
- Protect Monday/Tuesday deep work blocks
- Can use Thursday 3-5pm if absolutely needed

### Emergency Comes Up
- CEO/critical issues interrupt any meeting
- Operational emergencies interrupt deep work
- Reschedule the interrupted item to Friday or next week

### Out of Office / Travel
- Block out the time in `current-week.md`
- Pre-cancel recurring meetings
- Identify which meetings MUST happen (move to phone if needed)

*Remember: This is your system. Adjust it to work for you, not the other way around.*
