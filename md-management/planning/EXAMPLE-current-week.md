- FA decision made and approved by CEO
- Q1 financial review complete with CFO
- Cape Town staffing decision made, communicated to Elena
- Security remediation plan finalized
- Booking system architecture decided

### Not Completed ⏸️
- Q2 strategic planning document - 80% done, needs final polish

### Rolled to Next Week ⏭️

### Key Learnings 📚
- Need to give Elena more decision-making authority on staffing - she knows the situation best

- Innovation time on Wednesday morning is gold - solved the FA decision in that unstructured thinking time

### Adjustments Needed 🔧
- Wednesday MO meetings might need to be 75min instead of 60min - consistently running over
- Consider moving Amanda to Tuesday instead of Wednesday to separate from MO meeting

### Time Allocation Actual
- MD Work: ~22 hours (meetings + deep work)
- CTO Work: ~11 hours (meetings + deep work)
- Innovation: 2 hours
- Was allocation close to 60/30/10 target? Yes! 55/28/5/12 (12% flex/admin)
