## Key Principles

### Meeting Cadence Rationale

**Weekly 1:1s**:
- Kyle (Practice Manager): Monday 9am - runs own practice, needs weekly operational oversight; has ward rounds Tuesday morning so Monday works better
- Alida (Finance): Monday 10am - weekly financial pulse check, catch issues early, critical for MD oversight
- Yaseen (COO): Tuesday 9am - operational right-hand, needs tight alignment; placed on CTO day for quick ops check before technical deep work
- Amanda (Practice Manager): Wednesday 11am - runs separate practice + interim reports to you (vacant FA role); UK-based so 11am SA = 9am UK

**Bi-Weekly 1:1s**:
- Elena (Cape Town MO): Wednesday 12pm alternating weeks - business reviews not daily ops; Wednesday avoids their Monday ward rounds
- Ismaeel (London MO): Wednesday 12pm alternating weeks - business reviews not daily ops; 12pm SA = 10am UK for timezone; alternates with Elena
- CEO (James): Every other Thursday 11:30am (his preferred day), enough for strategic alignment without over-scheduling him; on Exco weeks for natural flow after Exco

**Alternating Weekly**:
- Project Meeting / Exco: Balance CTO (project oversight) and MD (executive leadership) without meeting overload; Thursday timing works for James

**Bi-Monthly Meetings**:
- Ricardo (Account Manager): Every 2 weeks (1st & 3rd Thursday) for tighter loop with head office

**Monthly Meetings**:
- Fractional CFO/CMO: External resources, monthly strategic reviews appropriate; scheduled 2nd & 4th Thursday to avoid Ricardo conflicts

### Protected Time Philosophy

1. **Deep Work Blocks**: Non-negotiable unless true emergency
2. **Innovation Time**: Wednesday morning - no calendar, just thinking/learning/strategy
3. **Friday Afternoon**: Flex time to catch overflow or protect as focus time

### Meeting Effectiveness Rules

1. **All 1:1s have agendas**: Sent by direct report 24h before
2. **Business reviews (MOs) have metrics**: Revenue, patients, team health, issues
3. **No meeting without clear purpose**: Every recurring meeting has defined outcomes
4. **Time-box everything**: Start and end on time, no exceptions
5. **Monthly reviews**: Assess if each meeting is still valuable, adjust cadence

## Future Considerations

**Founders Associate Position**:
- May not hire this role
- If hired: Weekly 1:1 needed, suggest Tuesday 10am (shift Kyle to 9am or other time)
- Amanda may transition to report to FA at that point

## Structure Adjustments Based on Feedback

### Final Changes Made ✅
1. **Project/Exco moved to Thursday 10am**: James's preferred business meeting day, alternating weekly
2. **Kyle moved to Monday 9am**: Has ward rounds Tuesday morning, unavailable then
3. **Yaseen moved to Tuesday 9am**: Allows full CTO day focus after this quick ops check-in
4. **Alida Monday 10am**: Tight weekly financial oversight
5. **Amanda moved to Wednesday 11am**: UK-based, 11am SA = 9am UK (timezone consideration)
6. **Medical Officers Wednesday 12pm**: Avoids their Monday ward rounds; 12pm SA = 10am UK for Ismaeel
7. **Monday = Full MD day**: 6h MD deep work after morning meetings
8. **Tuesday = Full CTO day**: 7h CTO deep work after Yaseen check-in
9. **CEO to Thursday 11:30am**: Bi-weekly following Exco (his preferred day)
10. **Ricardo bi-monthly**: 1st & 3rd Thursday for tighter head office loop
11. **CFO/CMO kept monthly**: 2nd & 4th Thursday to avoid Ricardo conflicts

### Design Principles Achieved
- **Meeting budget**: 5.5-7.5 hours/week (well within 10-15 hour target) ✅
- **Protected time**: 22 hours/week for deep work and innovation ✅
- **Day themes**: Monday (MD day), Tuesday (CTO day), Wednesday (medical + innovation), Thursday (executive), Friday (review) ✅
- **Role separation**: Full day focus on each role rather than daily switching ✅
- **Timezone consideration**: UK staff (Amanda, Ismaeel) meet at 11am+ SA time ✅
- **Scheduling conflicts resolved**: Kyle's Tuesday ward rounds avoided ✅
- **CEO flexibility**: Thursday suits him, bi-weekly cadence, can reschedule as needed ✅
