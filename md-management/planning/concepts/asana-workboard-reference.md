**Subject: Our Asana Work Board - Quick Reference**

Hi,

Following our chat about our new Asana work board, here's a quick reference for how it works.

**The Four Sections**

| Section | What goes here |
|---------|----------------|
| **Spotlight** | Current focus - the 2-5 tasks actively being worked on right now. Keep this tight. |
| **Backlog** | Everything else that needs doing. Add tasks here first, then move to Spotlight when starting. |
| **Waiting On** | Tasks blocked by someone else or an external dependency. Add a comment noting what's needed. |
| **Done** | Completed tasks. Move items here when finished. |

**Key Fields**

| Field | How to use it |
|-------|---------------|
| **Project** | Tag which project or work area the task belongs to. Helps us filter and see where effort is going. |
| **Due Date** | When we expect to complete the task. **Required for Spotlight items** - if it's in focus, it needs a target date. |

**How to Use It**

1. **Add new tasks to Backlog** - Don't worry about perfect wording; we'll refine together
2. **Move to Spotlight when you start** - Shows what's actively in progress
3. **Set a due date when moving to Spotlight** - Every active task needs a target completion date
4. **Update the Project field** - Helps us both see where effort is going
5. **Move to Waiting On if blocked** - Add a comment explaining what's needed
6. **Move to Done when complete**

**Keep It Current**

This board is our shared view of your work and how we communicate about priorities. For it to be useful, it needs to reflect reality - keep it updated as things change, not just at set times.

If something's stuck, flag it. If priorities shift, move things around. The board should always tell the true story of where things stand.
