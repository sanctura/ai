**Subject**: New Weekly Flash Reports - Starting Next Week

---

Hi team,

I'm introducing a simple weekly practice starting next week: **Flash Reports**.

**What**: A brief email update (5-10 minutes to write) sent every Friday afternoon.

**Why**: This gives me better visibility into what's happening across the team, helps me prepare for our 1:1s, and creates a lightweight way to flag blockers early. Rather than waiting for our meetings to surface issues, this gives us a regular pulse check.

**When**: Every Friday by 4pm (your local time). If you're on leave, skip that week.

**Format**: Reply to this email thread each week with:

1. **What I accomplished this week** (3-5 bullets)
2. **Challenges or blockers** (anything slowing you down or needing escalation)
3. **Next week's focus** (your top 2-3 priorities)
4. **Anything you need from me?** (decisions, support, input)

**Example:**

> **What I accomplished this week:**
> - Completed Q4 reconciliation and submitted to CFO
> - Resolved invoice dispute with supplier X
> - Interviewed two candidates for receptionist role
>
> **Challenges or blockers:**
> - Waiting on IT for access to new reporting system (raised last week)
>
> **Next week's focus:**
> - Finalise January payroll
> - Complete budget variance report
> - Follow up on receptionist interviews
>
> **Anything you need from me?**
> - Decision needed on which candidate to proceed with

**Keep it brief** - this should take 5-10 minutes max. Bullet points are fine. No need for polish or formal writing.

I'll read these over the weekend and come to our 1:1s better prepared. If you flag something urgent, I'll respond before Monday.

**Starting**: Friday, 7 February 2025

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Grant
