# Flash Reports

Weekly end-of-week updates from direct reports providing visibility into accomplishments, challenges, and upcoming priorities.

## Purpose

- Know what's happening across all reports without relying solely on 1:1s
- Spot recurring blockers or patterns early
- Better 1:1 prep with written context
- Trackable history of team progress
- Lightweight (5-10 min to write, 2-3 min to read)

## Schedule

**When**: Every Friday by 4pm (local time)
**How**: Email reply to the standing Flash Report thread
**Skip**: When on leave that week

## Template

**Subject**: Flash Report - [Name] - Week of [Date]

---

**What I accomplished this week:**
- [Most significant accomplishment]
- [Second item]
- [Third item]

**Challenges or blockers:**
- [Issues slowing progress, needing escalation, or requiring input]
- [Write "None this week" if clear]

**Next week's focus:**
- [Top priority]
- [Secondary priority]
- [Third priority if relevant]

**Anything you need from me?**
- [Decisions, support, input required]
- [Write "Nothing right now" if clear]

---

## Guidelines

- **Keep it brief**: 5-10 minutes max to write
- **Bullet points**: No prose required
- **Be honest**: Flag blockers early, don't hide problems
- **Prioritize**: List accomplishments in order of significance
- **Forward-looking**: Next week's focus should be specific, not vague

## For the MD

- Review flash reports over the weekend
- Reference specific items in Monday/Tuesday 1:1s
- Respond immediately if urgent blockers flagged
- Look for patterns across reports (common blockers, resource conflicts)
- Use to update `planning/current-week.md` priorities
