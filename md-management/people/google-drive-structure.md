| Reviews (Private) | Never share - your candid notes |
| Contracts & Offers | Never share |
| Role Descriptions | Share as needed for hiring/clarity |
| Exco | Share with exco members |
| Project Meetings | Share with project team |
| CEO Syncs | Never share |
| Finance | Never share |
| Strategy | Never share |
| Templates | Share as needed |

## Tips

- **"Private" suffix** - Makes confidential folders obvious at a glance
- **1-on-1 folders** - Put meeting agendas and shared notes here; keep review notes separate
- **Don't over-nest** - Keep structure flat for easy navigation
- **Review before sharing** - Always check folder permissions before adding sensitive docs
