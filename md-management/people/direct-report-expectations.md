# Direct Report Expectations

General expectations for all direct reports, separate from role-specific responsibilities outlined in individual job specs.

---

## 1. Attitude

Maintain a positive outlook and be a voice of reason to others in the business. How you show up affects your team and colleagues. Positive mindset grows strong teams - negativity is contagious, but so is optimism.

## 2. Communication

Keep me informed of important happenings and information pertinent to my role and the business. No surprises. Share bad news early - I'd rather know about a problem when it's small than discover it when it's a crisis.

## 3. Accountability

Own your outcomes - both successes and failures. When something goes wrong, acknowledge it and bring me the problem with your proposed solution. Do what you say you'll do, by when you said you'd do it. If circumstances change, tell me before deadlines slip.

## 4. Continuous Improvement

Look for ways to make things better. Question "the way we've always done it." Be curious, seek feedback, and stay open to learning. Growth isn't optional - the business evolves and we need to evolve with it.

## 5. Strategic Alignment

Understand how your work connects to business priorities. Make decisions that support our direction. If you're unsure whether something aligns, ask. We succeed when everyone is pulling in the same direction.
