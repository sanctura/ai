**Strengths noted during tenure**:
- Genuine care for patients and quality
- Strong regulatory/compliance knowledge (CQC, GMC)
- Thorough preparation and documentation

---

## 7. Concerns & Patterns

**All concerns closed by departure.**

**Post-Departure Risks**:
1. **London clinic has no GMC-registered doctor on-site**
   - Impact: CQC compliance position weakened; 7 clinical staff without medical leadership
   - Mitigation: Dr Wendy Denning and Prof Justin Stebbing as interim
   - Status: Needs immediate action

2. **Clinical staff leadership gap**
   - 7 nurses/locums (Maria Tam, Jasmin, Alicia, Maria Vega, Cecille, Michelle, Mel) need a reporting line
   - Maria Tam (Head Nurse) may step up operationally
   - Amanda Ross may need to absorb non-clinical oversight temporarily

## 8. Key Decisions & Context

### Decisions Involving This Person
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-08-19 | Hired as part-time locum (10 hrs/week) | GMC-registered doctor needed for London clinic | Worked until Feb 2026 |
| 2026-02-02 | 6-month sabbatical arrangement (~4 days/week) | Elena took NHS sabbatical to work full-time | Lasted 11 days |
| 2026-02-13 | Mutual departure | Irreconcilable disconnect on role expectations | Elena returning to NHS |

### Context for Future Reference
- Departure was mutual — both sides agreed it wasn't working
- Elena has NHS partner offer — she's landing well
- James had already hired Dr Wendy Denning for governance/CQC — Elena's governance push was redundant in his view
- Contract was never finalised with HR (Lauren) — may simplify exit
- Self-employed locum contractor — no employment law complications expected
- **Key lesson**: validate cultural fit and vision alignment before committing to full-time arrangements
- Grant's earlier assessment was "fixable situation" — turned out to be unfixable within the first two weeks
