# Patient-Facing Script — Dr Elena Hilton's Departure

**For**: Reception and nursing staff (London)
**Use when**: A patient asks about Dr Elena or mentions they expected to see her

---

## Standard Response

> "Dr Elena has moved on from Sanctura — she received an exciting opportunity to become a Partner at her NHS practice, which she decided to take up. We wish her all the best.
>
> Your care continues as normal — Dr Laporta and our clinical team are here to look after you, and we also have Dr Wendy Denning supporting the clinic. Is there anything I can help you with today?"

## If the patient presses for more detail

> "It was a personal career decision on Elena's part — she was offered a partnership in the NHS which was too good to pass up. We're really happy for her. Nothing changes in terms of the care you receive here."

## If the patient expresses concern about their ongoing care

> "I completely understand. Please be assured that Dr Laporta oversees all patient care and your treatment plan is fully documented. If you'd like, I can arrange for Dr Laporta or one of our clinical team to speak with you directly about your care."

**Key points to remember**:
- Keep it positive — this was Elena's choice to pursue a great opportunity
- Don't go into detail about internal matters
- Reassure patients their care is unaffected
- Offer to connect them with Dr Laporta or clinical staff if they need reassurance
- If a patient becomes upset or insistent, escalate to Amanda or Grant
