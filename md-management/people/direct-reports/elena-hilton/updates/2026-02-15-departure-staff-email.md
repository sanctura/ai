**Subject**: Update on Dr Elena Hilton

Hi everyone,

I wanted to let you know that Dr Elena Hilton has decided to move on from Sanctura and will not be continuing in her role as Medical Officer.

As some of you may know, Elena joined us on a sabbatical from the NHS to explore working in a private practice setting. During her time here, she received an offer to become a Partner at her NHS practice — which is a significant career milestone and an opportunity she has decided to take up. We fully understand and support her decision to pursue that path.

We're grateful for Elena's time with us and wish her every success in her new role.

In terms of what this means for the team — nothing changes in your day-to-day work. Maria Tam will continue leading the nursing team operationally, and Amanda remains your point of contact for all clinic and administrative matters. Dr Wendy Denning and Professor Justin Stebbing will be supporting the clinic's medical needs in the interim while we find a permanent replacement.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to speak with Amanda or myself.

Thank you,
Grant
