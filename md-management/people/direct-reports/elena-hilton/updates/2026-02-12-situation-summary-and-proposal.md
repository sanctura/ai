# Elena Hilton — Situation Summary & Proposed Resolution

**Prepared by**: Grant Merwitz (MD)
**Date**: 12 February 2026
**For**: James Laporta (CEO)
**Status**: Confidential — internal management use only

---

## 1. Situation Overview

Elena joined Sanctura full-time on 2 February 2026 under a 6-month sabbatical arrangement from the NHS (~4 days/week, 87.5 paid days over 26 weeks). Previously she worked 10 hours/week as a part-time locum since August 2025.

After just two weeks in this expanded role, there is significant friction between Elena and James. Both parties are frustrated, and the situation is escalating. Elena has indicated she is close to resigning. James has indicated he is willing to let her go if she's unhappy.

This needs to be addressed urgently before it becomes irreversible.

## 2. The Core Tension

This is fundamentally a **worldview misalignment**, not a personality conflict.

| Elena's Perspective | James's Perspective |
|---|---|
| Comes from a structured NHS environment with clear governance hierarchies | Runs an integrative oncology practice with a more fluid, founder-led model |
| As the GMC-registered doctor on-site, she feels personally accountable for clinical standards | As CEO and Medical Director, he has built this practice and its patient care model over many years |
| Sees gaps in governance, documentation, and protocol — and feels compelled to fix them | Sees someone who was hired to support his vision now trying to reshape it |
| Believes transparency and regulatory compliance are non-negotiable | Believes operational flexibility and clinical autonomy are core to how the practice works |

Neither perspective is wrong. Elena's regulatory awareness is genuinely valuable — CQC compliance is real and matters. James's clinical vision and founder authority are the foundation the business is built on. The problem is that **nobody has defined where one stops and the other starts**.

---

## 3. What the Contract Actually Says

Elena's existing locum agreement (dated 1 October 2025) contains two important clauses:

1. **Reporting**: "The Locum shall report to **Dr James Laporta (CEO and Medical Director)** for clinical matters and Amanda Ross (Practice Manager) for non-clinical matters."

2. **Services**: "Adjust patient care plans **in collaboration with, and with agreement from, the Medical Director**."

This is clear: **James holds the Medical Director title and clinical authority**. Elena's role is to support, advise, and collaborate — not to direct or override. This distinction appears to have been lost or never communicated clearly as she transitioned to full-time.

> **Note**: The updated contract is currently with HR (Lauren) and hasn't been finalised. This is an opportunity to ensure the new agreement makes reporting lines and clinical authority even more explicit.

---

## 4. The Business Risk

If Elena leaves, Sanctura loses its **only GMC-registered doctor on-site in London**. This creates:

- **Regulatory exposure**: CQC expects a registered clinician to be clearly accountable. Without one, the practice's compliance position weakens significantly.
- **Operational disruption**: Elena manages 7 clinical staff (Head Nurse + 6 nurses/locums). Losing her creates a leadership gap in the London clinic.
- **Timing**: We are two weeks into a 6-month arrangement. Her updated contract isn't even signed yet. Losing her now would be disruptive and hard to explain to the team.
- **Replacement difficulty**: Finding another GMC-registered doctor willing to work in a private integrative oncology setting — who also understands and supports James's model — would take significant time.

This doesn't mean we accommodate behaviour that undermines the business. It means we should **try to make this work before accepting failure**.

---

## 5. What's Driving Elena's Behaviour

Understanding her motivations helps manage the conversation:

- **Professional liability anxiety**: As the registered doctor, she genuinely feels her GMC registration is on the line. If something goes wrong clinically, regulators come for her — not James (who holds a different registration). This fear is real and valid.
- **Culture shock**: Moving from a 10-hour-per-week peripheral role to full-time immersion has exposed her to the daily reality of how the practice runs. Things that were invisible at 10hrs/week are now front and centre.
- **NHS conditioning**: In the NHS, the registered doctor holds authority. In Sanctura, the CEO/Medical Director holds authority. Elena hasn't fully internalised this difference.
- **Genuine care**: She does care about patients and about doing things right. Her strategy meeting prep (sharing the full CQC framework) shows diligence, even if the timing and framing add friction.
- **Feeling excluded**: Not being invited to a business dinner, not being looped into certain meetings — she interprets these as signs of distrust rather than understanding they relate to broader business matters outside her scope.

---

## 6. What's Driving James's Frustration

- **Interference on the floor**: Elena inserting herself into James's patient conversations is disruptive and undermining. James needs to be able to operate freely in his own practice.
- **Constant questioning**: Every patient meeting James has, every late-running appointment, every external doctor he speaks with — Elena questions it. This creates a surveillance dynamic rather than a supportive one.
- **Attempting to change the model**: James didn't hire Elena to redesign how the practice works. He hired her to support and strengthen what he's building. The constant push toward NHS-style governance feels like rejection of his approach.
- **Lack of trust**: The cumulative effect of suspicion, interruption, and second-guessing has eroded James's willingness to work openly with Elena — the opposite of what she says she wants.

---

## 7. Proposed Path Forward

### Immediate: Strategy Meeting (Tomorrow)

- **Don't let this meeting become a battleground**. Elena has pre-loaded it with CQC governance topics. James should engage with these constructively — they're legitimate topics — but steer the conversation toward practical role definition rather than abstract governance structures.
- **Acknowledge Elena's regulatory knowledge is valuable**, while being clear that operational decisions remain with the Medical Director (James).
- **Use the meeting to set up the clarity session** (below), not to resolve everything in one go.

### Within 1 Week: Clarity & Expectations Session (Grant to facilitate)

A structured sit-down covering:

1. **Role definition**: Elena's job is to support the Medical Director's clinical vision, manage the clinical team, ensure day-to-day clinical standards, and contribute her expertise — not to direct or override clinical strategy.

2. **Clinical authority**: James is the Medical Director. Care plans are adjusted "in collaboration with and with agreement from" him. This is in the contract and won't change.

3. **How to raise concerns**: Elena should bring specific, evidence-based concerns through proper channels (to Grant or James directly in 1:1s), not through interruption on the clinic floor or speculation. If she has a legitimate patient safety concern, there should be a clear escalation process.

4. **Boundaries**: Not everything is Elena's business. Business dinners, external meetings, and broader company strategy are outside her role. This isn't a lack of transparency — it's normal organisational structure.

5. **What success looks like**: Define 3-5 concrete things Elena should focus on in the next 90 days. Give her clear goals so she can channel her energy productively.

6. **The honest conversation**: If Elena cannot accept this role as defined — supporting James's vision within clear boundaries — then this arrangement won't work. That's not a threat; it's a reality. Better to know now than 4 months in.

### Ongoing: Contract Update

Ensure the updated contract (currently with HR) explicitly states:
- James's role as Medical Director with clinical authority
- Elena's reporting line and scope
- Clear description of services that reflects the support/advisory nature of her role
- Any governance responsibilities she does own (e.g., CQC documentation, clinical team management)

---

## 8. Talking Points for James

For the strategy meeting and subsequent conversations:

**Acknowledging Elena's value:**
- "Your regulatory knowledge is something we haven't had before, and it's valuable."
- "The CQC framework you shared is useful — let's work out how to apply it practically to our setting."
- "I want you to succeed here. Having a registered doctor who cares about standards is exactly what we need."

**Setting boundaries:**
- "I'm the Medical Director. I welcome your input on clinical decisions, but final authority on care approach sits with me."
- "When you have concerns, I need you to bring them to me or Grant in our regular meetings — not on the clinic floor in front of patients or staff."
- "Not every meeting or dinner is about the clinic. There are parts of the business that sit outside your role, and that's normal in any organisation."

**Being direct about what needs to change:**
- "I need you working with me, not monitoring me. The current dynamic isn't sustainable for either of us."
- "I understand this is a big transition from the NHS. But this is a different environment, and I need you to adapt to how we work here — while bringing your expertise to make it better."
- "If you have genuine patient safety concerns, I want to hear them — backed by specifics. What I can't work with is general suspicion or second-guessing."

**Opening the door:**
- "Let's be honest about whether this is going to work for both of us. I'd rather have that conversation now than six months from now."
- "What do you need from me to feel supported in this role?"

---

## Summary

This is a fixable situation — but only if both sides commit to a clearly defined working relationship. Elena has real value to offer. James has legitimate authority to protect. The missing piece is a formal, explicit agreement on role boundaries, clinical authority, and how concerns get raised.

The strategy meeting tomorrow is an opportunity to start that conversation. The formal clarity session within the next week should lock it in. And the updated contract should codify it.

If after all that Elena can't operate within these boundaries, then we'll know — and we'll plan accordingly.
