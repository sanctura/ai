Subject: Strategy meeting

Dear All,

For our upcoming strategy meeting, I would like us to focus on the following key areas:

-   Clarifying regulatory accountability as the GMC-registered doctor
    
-   Aligning our governance structure with UK regulatory standards
    
-   Ensuring a sustainable and defensible clinical model as we grow
    

I believe it is important that we align clearly on these foundations as part of our wider strategic development.

Warm regards,  
Elena

Subject: CQC Key Lines of Enquiry (KLOEs) – For Tomorrow’s Strategy Meeting

Hi me again ...

Ahead of tomorrow’s strategy meeting, I wanted to share the five CQC Key Lines of Enquiry (KLOEs), in case you are not fully familiar with them.

I will reference  this framework during our discussion, as many of the topics we are reviewing sit directly within it.

* * *

## ![1️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0031_fe0f_20e3/72.png) SAFETY 

**Are people protected from abuse and avoidable harm?**

CQC considers:

-   How risk is identified and managed
    
-   How incidents are reported and learned from
    
-   Whether medicines are managed safely
    
-   Whether clinical accountability is clear
    
-   Whether safeguarding processes are robust
    

In our setting (private integrative oncology), this includes:

-   IV infusion governance
    
-   Hyperthermia protocols
    
-   Escalation procedures
    
-   Clear documentation of clinical responsibility
    

* * *

## ![2️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0032_fe0f_20e3/72.png) EFFECTIVE

**Does care, treatment and support achieve good outcomes?**

CQC considers:

-   Whether care is evidence-based
    
-   Whether staff are competent and appropriately trained
    
-   Whether outcomes are monitored
    
-   Whether there is multidisciplinary working
    
-   Whether patients are involved in shared decision-making
    

In practice, this includes:

-   Documented consent for integrative therapies
    
-   Clear evidence rationale for treatments such as IV Vitamin C, hyperthermia and PBM
    
-   Outcome tracking
    
-   Clear documentation of plan ownership
    

* * *

## ![3️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0033_fe0f_20e3/72.png) CARING

**Are people treated with kindness, dignity and respect?**

CQC asks whether:

-   Patients feel listened to
    
-   Communication is clear and compassionate
    
-   Patients are supported in decision-making
    
-   Privacy and dignity are respected
    

This links to issues such as:

-   Patients not feeling heard
    
-   Mixed messages between clinical and administrative teams
    
-   Communication during delays
    
-   Clarity around what happens next
    

Inspectors often ask patients whether they:

-   Felt involved
    
-   Understood costs
    
-   Knew what would happen next
    

* * *

## ![4️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0034_fe0f_20e3/72.png) RESPONSIVE

**Does the service respond to people’s needs?**

CQC considers:

-   Timely access to care
    
-   Clarity of appointment systems
    
-   Communication about delays
    
-   Complaint handling
    
-   Fee transparency
    
-   Communication of results
    
-   Safe transitions of care
    

In inspection reports, this is where issues such as:

-   Booking friction
    
-   Unexpected invoices
    
-   Delays in results
    
-   Poor handovers
    
-   Unclear next steps
    

are commonly identified.

CQC is particularly sensitive to:

-   Vulnerable patients
    
-   Cancer patients
    
-   Financial transparency in private services
    

* * *

## ![5️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0035_fe0f_20e3/72.png) WELL-LED

**Is leadership, management and governance effective?**

This is particularly important in protecting both the organisation and regulated clinicians.

CQC looks at:

-   Clarity of clinical leadership
    
-   Defined accountability
    
-   Governance framework
    
-   Risk escalation
    
-   Policy review
    
-   Learning from complaints
    
-   Culture of openness
    

* * *

## How CQC Uses This Framework

Inspectors typically:

-   Review policies
    
-   Review incident logs
    
-   Review complaints
    
-   Interview staff
    
-   Interview patients
    
-   Observe systems in practice
    
-   Check documentation
    
-   Assess leadership structure
