### 2026-02-12 — First Two Weeks Observations (Grant) `[observation]` `[concern]`

**Context**: Elena began her 6-month sabbatical arrangement on 2 Feb 2026, working ~4 days/week full-time after previously being part-time (10hrs/week locum). These observations cover the first two weeks of this new arrangement.

**Stress & Wellbeing**:
- Elena is feeling stressed and anxious; reports losing sleep over the situation
- Has mentioned she's either written or ready to write her resignation — significant flight risk

**Relationship with CEO (James)**:
- James is frustrated — feels Elena is constantly trying to change how patients are looked after rather than supporting his vision
- Elena interrupts or inserts herself into James's patient conversations on the floor, causing friction
- Elena becomes suspicious when James meets patients she doesn't know about; raises transparency concerns
- Elena was upset about not being invited to a business dinner — needs to understand boundaries between clinic operations and broader business matters
- James has indicated if Elena is unhappy, she should leave

**Role Clarity Issues**:
- Elena appears to see herself as a partner rather than an employee hired to support the CEO's vision
- Frequently references her GMC registration, UK medical standards, and NHS background to assert authority — becoming repetitive
- Concerned about James running late with patients and potential reputation damage — was asked to bring actual complaints rather than speculating
- Worried about Wendy Denning introducing James to another doctor — needs to understand James's autonomy in business development
- Seems to want involvement in all business discussions, but there are broader business matters beyond her scope

**Positive Observations**:
- Genuinely cares about patients and believes in making a difference
- Believes in supporting people and quality care
- Proactive in sharing CQC regulatory framework with directors ahead of strategy meeting — shows diligence on compliance

**Assessment**: Serious settling-in issues. Core tension between Elena's structured NHS background and James's integrative medicine approach. Risk of losing our only registered medical officer if not managed carefully. A clarity-and-expectations session is essential — clear role definition with an accept-or-move-on framing.

### 2026-02-12 — Strategy Meeting Prep `[observation]`

Elena sent two emails to directors (James, Grant, Ricardo) ahead of tomorrow's strategy meeting:
1. Requested focus on: regulatory accountability (GMC), governance alignment with UK standards, sustainable clinical model
2. Shared the full CQC Key Lines of Enquiry (KLOEs) framework — Safety, Effective, Caring, Responsive, Well-Led

Shows thoroughness and regulatory awareness, but also reflects her ongoing push to formalise governance in ways that may conflict with James's operational approach.
