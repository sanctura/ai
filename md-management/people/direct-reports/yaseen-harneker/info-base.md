# Yaseen Harneker - Information Base

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-15
**Quick Status**: Under close scrutiny — serious historical concerns from COO tenure (unsigned contracts, poor handover, inefficient processes). Showing early signs of stepping up in CPO role. Board denied inflation increase. Performance conversation pending.

---

## 1. Performance Status

**Overall Rating**: Underperforming (historical) / Improving (current CPO role)
**Trajectory**: Cautiously upward — starting to deliver on project work after slow adjustment, but significant legacy issues documented
**Last Formal Review**: N/A

**Current Concerns**:
- Historical operational negligence: employees hired without signed contracts (unit manager, Dr Ismaeel, Kyle) — first noted 2026-02-15

- Remco incident — meeting about remuneration without Grant's knowledge after extensive alignment on project-only focus — first noted 2026-02-15
- Potential quiet quitting risk — initial adjustment period showed disengagement, now improving — first noted 2026-02-15
- Invoicing inefficiency under his watch (UK and SA) — potentially significant lost revenue — first noted 2026-02-15

## 4. Task & Assignment Tracking

**Open Assignments**:
- [ ] Chemo application — major project: writing, pharmaceutical company meeting, PAIA follow-up, plan availability
- [ ] Dr Hari referral fee agreement — close to completion, awaiting Dr Hari's response
- [ ] Hydrovitality handover to Mohammed — check availability to finalise
- [ ] Performance conversation re: no inflation increase — Grant to schedule

**Recently Completed** (last 30 days):
- [x] Handover to Grant completed (2026-02-06)
- [x] Remco increase proposal completed and sent to Grant (2026-02-06)
- [x] MDT and Medical board handover to Elena completed (2026-02-06)
- [x] HBOT gas query — resolved, report submitted (2026-02-06)
- [x] Chemo application pre-work: architect appointment, DoH engagement, regulations review, PAIA request (2026-02-06 to 2026-02-13)
- [x] mEHT motivation templates shared with Dr Ismaeel (2026-02-13)
- [x] London project costs reviewed for Ricardo (2026-02-13)

**Patterns**:
- On-time completion: Good on current project work — delivering consistently on chemo application milestones
- Communication on blockers: Improving — noted chemo quantification challenge, accommodated flash report feedback
- Historical: Poor follow-through on operational/administrative items (contracts, expectations, handover)

---

## 5. Development & Growth

**Strengths Being Leveraged**:
- Strong on research-heavy, complex projects (chemo application, regulatory work)
- Good stakeholder coordination (architect, DoH, pharmaceutical companies, Dr Hari)
- Completing handovers as requested
- Flash reports being submitted consistently with good detail

**Growth Areas**:
- **Administrative rigour**: Signing contracts, documenting expectations, maintaining records — historically very poor
- **Transparency**: Remco incident showed tendency to hold on to activities without communicating — needs ongoing monitoring
- **Operational management**: Demonstrated ineffectiveness as COO — processes, invoicing, team structure all deficient
- **Adjustment to new role**: Moving from COO authority to IC project role — initially resistant, now improving

**Skill Development Timeline**:
| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2025-01-01 | Transitioned from COO to CPO — reports transferred to Grant |
| 2025-01 (approx) | Work board set up, project focus agreed (2 big + 3 small projects) |
| 2026-02-06 | First flash report — productive, project-focused output |
| 2026-02-13 | Second flash report — strong chemo application progress, no blockers |

## 6. Flash Report Trends

**Submission Rate**: 2 of 2 weeks (100%)
**Reports on file**: 2 (2026-02-06, 2026-02-13)

**Recurring Themes**:
- Accomplishments: Chemo application progress (dominant theme), handovers, regulatory engagement, stakeholder coordination
- Blockers: Chemo patient quantification (week 1), none (week 2) — low blocker reporting
- Asks: Automated chemo patient data (week 1), none (week 2)

**Sentiment Trend**: Professional and focused. Week 2 note about accommodating feedback on flash report format shows responsiveness. Content is project-heavy and structured. No signs of disengagement in written reports.

## 7. Concerns & Patterns

**Active Concerns**:
1. **Historical operational negligence (COO tenure)**
   - First observed: 2026-02-15 (Grant documenting retroactively)
   - Issues: Employees hired without signed contracts (unit manager ~2 months ago, Dr Ismaeel, Kyle new responsibilities). Kyle's 3-month expectations never created. Nursing unit structure lacks formal comms and reporting lines. Invoicing processes inefficient in UK and SA — significant revenue potentially lost.
   - Impact: Grant now having to rework basics (contracts, structure, processes) instead of focusing on MD priorities
   - Status: Being documented — needs formal conversation with Yaseen

2. **Poor handover quality**
   - First observed: 2026-02-15
   - Issue: Only informal typed notes from 2-week period. No formal contracts, expectations, or performance tracking for former reports. Amanda's reported issues undocumented.
   - Status: Handover complete but inadequate — Grant rebuilding from scratch

3. **Remco incident / transparency concerns**
   - First observed: ~2025-01
   - Issue: Met with departing FM about remuneration without Grant's knowledge, immediately after extensive alignment on project-only focus. People involved no longer report to him.
   - Assessment: Grant felt this was intentional gatekeeping but chose to take Yaseen's word
   - Status: Addressed once — monitoring for recurrence

4. **No inflation increase — communication pending**
   - Board decision: Yaseen will not receive inflation-based increase with rest of staff
   - Reason: Past performance shortcomings in COO role
   - Status: Grant needs to communicate this clearly, framing as consequence of past discretions (not role change)
   - Risk: Could trigger resignation or escalated quiet quitting

5. **Quiet quitting risk**
   - First observed: ~2025-01
   - Initial period of disengagement/resistance after role change
   - Current: Appears to be stepping up after 2-3 weeks
   - Status: Monitoring — flash reports show engagement

**Leading Indicators to Watch**:
- Flash report quality and timeliness — current engagement proxy
- Chemo application milestone delivery — primary project
- Any operational activities outside project scope (Remco-type incidents)
- Reaction to no-increase conversation
- Transparency and proactive communication

## 8. Key Decisions & Context

### Decisions Involving This Person
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-01-01 | Moved from COO to CPO, lost all direct reports | CEO and Board decision — Grant more effective as operational leader | Role transition complete, adjustment ongoing |
| 2025-01 (approx) | Project portfolio agreed: 2 big + 3 small projects | Focus Yaseen's energy, clear scope | In progress — chemo application is primary |
| 2026-02-15 | Board: no inflation increase this year | Past COO performance shortcomings | Pending communication from Grant |

### Context for Future Reference
- Weekly 1:1 on Tuesday
- Senior leadership role — no direct reports
- Owns complex, multi-stakeholder strategic projects critical to company expansion
- Key focus areas: chemotherapy licensing (primary), radiation bunker development, capital equipment, regulatory infrastructure
- Uses "Project as Custom Field" model in Asana: Spotlight/Backlog/Waiting On/Done sections
- Was originally COO, hired ~12 months before Grant. Role change effective Jan 2025.
- Yaseen was not happy about the change — James gave extended time to adjust
- Historical role as London clinic builder — hired people, set up machines and processes
- Previously handed over London operational oversight items to Amanda Ross
- Departed financial manager: sole FM, 30-day notice, Yaseen and Grant documented all responsibilities — led to discovery of Remco meeting
- Grant's assessment: Yaseen has been "a very ineffective operational person" with "borderline negligent" actions (e.g., hiring without contracts)
- Performance documentation being built now to support potential future performance management if quiet quitting resumes
- No 1:1 meeting notes on file yet — need to start documenting
