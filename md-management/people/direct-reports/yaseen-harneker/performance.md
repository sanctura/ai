## Log

### 2026-02-15 `[concern]`
Grant documenting historical concerns about Yaseen's operational tenure as COO. Multiple employees hired without signed contracts: unit manager (hired ~2 months ago, contract still unsigned), Dr Ismaeel Ebrahim (contract incomplete), Kyle Bennett (new responsibilities, contract incomplete). When Kyle was promoted to Practice Manager, Yaseen was supposed to create 3-month expectations to track performance — this was never done, and the 3 months have now passed with no documented assessment. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-15 `[concern]`
Yaseen's operational handover to Grant lacked substance — only informal typed notes from a 2-week period, no formal handover of contracts, expectations, or tracked performance notes for his former reports. In the UK, there are notes about Amanda having various reported issues, but nothing documented that Grant can action. Nursing unit structure also lacks formal comms and clear reporting lines, causing Grant to rework basics. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-15 `[concern]`
Invoicing processes under Yaseen's tenure in both UK and SA were very inefficient — huge concern that significant money has been lost due to bad invoicing. Grant identified a new process and rolled it out within a week, suggesting the fix was not complex. Raises questions about why this was not addressed sooner. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-15 `[observation]`
Board has decided Yaseen will not receive an inflation-based increase this year with the rest of staff, due to past performance shortcomings in the COO role. Grant needs to meet with Yaseen to communicate this clearly — framing it as consequence of past discretions, not related to role change or compensation loss. This conversation needs to be on record in case of future performance management needs. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-15 `[concern]`
Remco (remuneration review) incident: After an extensive week of documenting every financial manager responsibility and repeatedly aligning on Yaseen's project-only focus, Yaseen was found to be meeting with the departing financial manager about Remco (employee remuneration) — a project never mentioned in any discussions, involving people who no longer report to him, with a departing manager. Grant confronted Yaseen; he claimed he "didn't think of it." Grant accepted this but flagged it as concerning — felt intentional and like gatekeeping. Yaseen needs to be transparent about such activities going forward. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-15 `[observation]`
Background context: Yaseen was originally COO, hired ~12 months before Grant. Board decided Jan 2025 to move Grant into MD role with Yaseen's reports transferring to Grant, and Yaseen becoming CPO with no direct reports. Yaseen was not comfortable with this change and needed extended time to adjust. After 2-3 weeks of what felt like potential quiet quitting, Grant believes Yaseen is starting to step up in the CPO role. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-13 `[achievement]`
Flash report (week ending 2026-02-13): Made progress on chemo application — met architect for site assessment, communicated with DoH, submitted PAIA request, secured pharmaceutical company appointment. Shared mEHT motivation templates with Dr Ismaeel. Reviewed London project costs for Ricardo. Dr Hari referral fee agreement close to completion. Productive week with no blockers reported. *(Source: flash report)*

### 2026-02-06 `[achievement]`
Flash report (week ending 2026-02-06): Completed handover to Grant. Completed Remco increase proposal. Significant chemo application pre-work (architect, DoH, regulations). Completed MDT and Medical board handover to Elena. Resolved HBOT gas query. *(Source: flash report)*

### 2026-02-06 `[observation]`
Challenge flagged: quantifying chemo patients and referrals for chemo application. Ask: automated system to draw chemo patient numbers for the application. *(Source: flash report)*
