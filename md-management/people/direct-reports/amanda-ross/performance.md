## Log

### 2026-02-13 `[concern]`
Missed flash report this week — was off on Friday and did not send it before leaving. Was not explicitly told what to do when off on a Friday, but a proactive employee would have sent it before leaving. Also did not provide any handover info or things to look out for on her day off, showing a lack of forward thinking. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-13 `[concern]`
CEO's critical medications were delivered and put into the pharmacy without anyone communicating it. When James was leaving on Friday, he had to search for them. This is not the first time deliveries are received and placed somewhere without informing the relevant person. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-13 `[concern]`
James's examination bed in his office was in an unacceptable state — large boxed whiteboard blocking it, preventing patient examinations. Grant told Amanda on Tuesday to urgently remove it. By Wednesday evening it was still not done. When asked, she said it was too heavy to move but had not communicated the blocker. Grant helped her move it. Failure to escalate when blocked. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-13 `[observation]`
Grant notes Amanda is not sitting at reception as requested — positive compliance with the expectation set on 2026-02-11. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-13 `[observation]`
Grant held a long expectations-setting session with Amanda this week. She appeared to receive the direction and openness well, seemed to take feedback on board. Early signs of stepping up. However, CEO (James) continues to be frustrated. Grant intends to continue giving her the opportunity with feedback and direction. *(Source: Grant observation)*

### 2026-02-06 `[achievement]`
Flash report submitted (week ending 2026-02-06): Onboarded new receptionist Saba (week one induction complete), resolved heating issues, introduced invoicing system rollout with nurses successfully completing treatment invoices and increased payments taken in clinic. *(Source: flash report)*

### 2026-02-06 `[observation]`
Challenges reported: busy week with new starter onboarding and Dr Laporta in clinic caused delays to CQC policy updates and Dr Denning work. Ask: confirmation on Maria Vega contract change from fixed term to permanent. *(Source: flash report)*

### 2026-02-11 `[observation]`
Positive observations over the last two weeks: submitted flash report as requested, supplied nursing roster, and ensured the 8am Monday meeting happened when CEO was in town. All completed without reminder. Consistently first in, last out — demonstrates high commitment and long hours. *(Source: Grant meeting prep)*

### 2026-02-10 `[feedback-received]`
CEO feedback (relayed via Grant): Frustrated by recurring forgetfulness on assigned tasks — Amanda has been tasked with various activities over time that she keeps forgetting, responding with an "oopsie" reaction when reminded. Multiple operational items not attended to: deliveries mismanaged (Elena's package, Grant's Christmas gift found a month later), Polycom in private patient suite signed in with personal account, fridge not stocked, expensive hyperthermia equipment improperly stored on crystals in pharmacy, crystals not placed around office as requested, incense stored in pharmacy, display window lacking stock, stock samples with stickers not removed, travel bags in pharmacy instead of storage, HBOT room needs extraction fan, decorative rocks not lit up as requested, charging chair in private suite not set up. CEO expects practice manager to work the floor daily with a checklist, inspecting rooms and building a snag list. CEO is frustrated by lack of attention but acknowledges Amanda's commitment, effort, and long hours. Willing to support Grant's process of setting clear expectations. *(Source: James feedback)*

### 2026-02-10 `[observation]`
Handover from Yaseen (batch 1) — open items Amanda is managing: Maria Vega employment contract (draft ready, Amanda to close off; Maria V recently started 3 days/week, exploring more full-time arrangement; also exploring room rental at 20% discount on 60 GBP/hr), Maria Tam periodic review (6-monthly check on private practice arrangement — Amanda may have had the conversation recently), CQC policy review (in progress, annual requirement, policies initially drawn up by Amanda and reviewed by external expert), plant wall installation (closing off with Plant Care), Lexee salary request (started 07 July 2025, no prior experience, feedback is she has excelled — consider at annual increase). *(Source: Yaseen handover email)*

### 2026-02-10 `[observation]`
Handover from Yaseen (batch 2) — facilities items: lift shaft cleaning (done, check if repaint needed), HBOT signage (up but needs images/graphics), UK breathwork room conversion to immersive sensory room (in progress, unclear instructions, Amanda adding/removing as requests come in, items still outstanding), shelving for store room and studio (to be ordered, previous payment issues), glass board for consulting room (procuring alternative — previous board too heavy for drywall), water dispenser for waiting room (sourcing, challenges with aesthetics/plumbing/functionality), ventilation/cooling for HBOT room and pharmacy store (costly solution, needs landlord approval, long lead times, specialist contractor drawings required), daily walkthrough checklist (implemented and updated by Amanda). *(Source: Yaseen handover email)*
