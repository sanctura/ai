---

## Meeting Objectives

### 1. Acknowledge Positives
- Flash report submitted as requested — without reminder
- Nursing roster supplied on time
- Monday 8am meeting organised when CEO in town
- Commitment and effort is visible — first in, last out, clearly cares about the business

### 2. Set Clear Expectations: Reception vs Floor
- Two receptionists should man reception independently, backing each other up
- PM should only sit at reception as backup if both receptionists unavailable
- Otherwise: walk the floor looking for things out of place, checking in on staff, or working on projects/CQC items in an available room
- This needs to be permanent — not just when CEO is in London

### 3. Daily Floor Walks & Snag List
- Expectation: work the floor daily, maintaining a snag list
- Inspect each room, think about what needs improvement
- Strive for "Michelin star" level clinic experience
- Rooms can be tackled daily or become a focus topic for the week

### 4. Work Board Adoption (Asana)
- Introduce Asana work board as shared communication platform
- Purpose: prioritise multiple tasks, track progress, ensure nothing forgotten
- Will be reviewed in weekly 1:1s

### 5. Nurse Coverage (if time permits)
- CEO concern: too many nurses on some days
- Need to understand why and determine ideal number
- May defer to a separate session

### 6. Monday 8am Meeting Process (for future reference)
- Confirm attendance with all staff the week before
- Get those who can practically attend to be there at 8am
- Only staff working late for coverage should be missing
- Send ahead of time a list of who can/cannot make it
- Next CEO visit is a few weeks out — time to set this up properly

---

## Tone & Approach
- Constructive, not punitive — setting expectations as a new manager
- Amanda is not failing; expectations haven't been clear enough previously
- Instructions have sometimes been confusing — acknowledge this
- Goal: set her up for success so she can become a high-performing employee
