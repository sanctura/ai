**Recently Completed** (last 30 days):
- [x] Flash report submission process — first report submitted 2026-02-06
- [x] Nursing roster — submitted 2026-02-10
- [x] Saba week one induction — completed 2026-02-06

- [x] Lift shaft cleaning — done (check if repaint needed)

**Patterns**:
- On-time completion: Inconsistent — responds to direct instructions but misses items without reminders; fails to escalate when blocked
- Communication on blockers: Poor — "oopsie" response when reminded; exam bed example shows she tries but doesn't communicate when stuck
- Flash report compliance: Missed when off on Friday — needs explicit process for absence days

## 5. Development & Growth

**Strengths Being Leveraged**:
- High commitment — first in, last out, long hours
- Cares deeply about the business
- Strong on CQC compliance — holds the CQC license
- Responsive to direct, clear instructions (floor presence compliance within days)
- Invoicing rollout showing operational capability when focused

**Growth Areas**:
- **Proactive attention to detail**: Picking up issues without being told — progress: expectations set 2026-02-11, mixed results
- **Task follow-through**: Completing assigned items without repeated reminders — progress: ongoing concern
- **Communication on blockers**: Escalating when stuck rather than going silent — progress: exam bed incident 2026-02-13
- **Prioritisation**: Working the floor vs sitting at reception — progress: complying as of 2026-02-13
- **Forward thinking**: Handover planning for days off, anticipating needs — progress: not yet demonstrated

**Skill Development Timeline**:
| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2026-02-11 | Expectations-setting session held — floor presence, snag list, work board |
| 2026-02-06 | First flash report submitted — good quality content |

## 7. Concerns & Patterns

**Active Concerns**:
1. **Recurring forgetfulness / lack of attention to detail**
   - First observed: 2026-02-10 (CEO feedback covering extended period)
   - Occurrences: Multiple — deliveries mismanaged, equipment stored improperly, clinic items not actioned, exam bed not cleared, medication delivery not communicated
   - Addressed: Yes — expectations session 2026-02-11, further incidents 2026-02-13
   - Status: Ongoing — Grant considering documented conversation (strike 2 of 3)

2. **Communication failures when blocked**
   - First observed: 2026-02-13 (exam bed incident)
   - Pattern: Tries to complete task, gets stuck, goes silent instead of escalating
   - Addressed: Yes — Grant discussed directly
   - Status: Monitoring

3. **Flash report compliance on absence days**
   - First observed: 2026-02-13
   - Issue: Did not send flash report before Friday absence, no handover info provided
   - Addressed: Pending — needs to be explicitly communicated
   - Status: To be addressed

4. **Delivery management**
   - First observed: 2026-02-13 (medication incident), noted as recurring
   - Issue: Packages received and stored without communicating to anyone
   - Impact: CEO could not find critical medications; potential patient safety and financial risk
   - Status: Process needs to be implemented

**Leading Indicators to Watch**:
- Flash report submission timing (compliance with Friday 4pm deadline, especially on absence weeks)
- Snag list activity (evidence of daily floor walks)
- Task completion without reminders
- CEO satisfaction during London visits
- Communication quality when blocked on tasks
- Delivery logging and notification

## 8. Key Decisions & Context

### Decisions Involving This Person
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2026-02-13 | Grant considering documented conversation if another incident occurs (strike 3) | Pattern of missed tasks despite expectations session | Pending — monitoring |
| 2026-02-11 | Set explicit floor walk and reception expectations | CEO feedback + forgetfulness pattern | Complying |
| 2026-02-11 | Introduce Asana work board | Need structured task tracking | Not started |

### Context for Future Reference
- UK-based — meetings at 11am+ SAST (Wednesday weekly)
- Holds CQC license for London clinic — critical compliance dependency
- Start date: 01 November 2024 (15 months in role); probation should have been completed ~Feb 2025 — check if written confirmation was issued
- Notice period: 3 months (post-probation)
- Yaseen recently handed over London operational oversight to Amanda (batch 1 & 2 items)
- CEO acknowledges Amanda's commitment and effort despite frustrations
- Instructions have sometimes been unclear — acknowledged in expectations session
- Receptionists (Saba + TBC) should man reception independently; Amanda as backup only
- Grant is frustrated by need to address issues daily — concerned about negative trajectory
- Maria Vega contract change (fixed to permanent) pending Grant's confirmation

---

## 9. Relationship Network

**Reports To**: Grant Merwitz (MD)
**Direct Reports**: Saba (Receptionist), second receptionist TBC
**Key Stakeholders**:
- James (CEO) — relationship: strained — frustrated by forgetfulness but acknowledges effort
- Yaseen (former operational oversight) — handover completed
- Elena Hilton — Amanda is Elena's non-clinical reporting line
- Lexee — training Saba, salary review pending

**Collaboration Quality**:
- With CEO: Strained — ongoing frustration despite acknowledged effort
- With clinical staff: Manages nursing roster, coordinates with Elena's team, invoicing rollout going well
- Cross-location: London-based, limited cross-location interaction
