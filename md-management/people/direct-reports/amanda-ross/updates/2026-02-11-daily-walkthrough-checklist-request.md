Hi Amanda,

Yaseen mentioned during his handover that you have an updated version of the daily walkthrough checklist for the UK unit. Could you please share the latest version with me?

For reference, below is what Yaseen included in his notes:

- Books are the right way around and in the right direction
- Areas are clean and appropriately arranged (furniture, no tripping hazards, etc)
- Flowers in relevant locations
- Snacks and water replenished
- Display cabinets full and neat
- Bins cleaned
- Lights and A/Cs on
- Music on
- Sound bowl
- Cables neat
- Hand soap, tissues and hand towels replenished
- Bathrooms clean and sufficient hand towels and toilet paper

I'd like to get the full updated list so we can make sure it's properly documented and part of your work board going forward.

Thanks,
Grant
