## How I Expect You to Work (universal direct report expectations)

### 1. Attitude
Show up positive. Be a voice of reason. Your energy affects the whole team — negativity is contagious, but so is optimism.

### 2. Communication
Keep me informed. No surprises. Share bad news early — I'd rather know about a problem when it's small than discover it when it's a crisis.

### 3. Accountability
Own your outcomes — both successes and failures. Do what you say you'll do, by when you said you'd do it. If circumstances change, tell me before deadlines slip. When something goes wrong, bring me the problem with your proposed solution.

### 4. Continuous Improvement
Look for ways to make things better. Question "the way we've always done it." Be curious, seek feedback, stay open to learning.

### 5. Strategic Alignment
Understand how your work connects to business priorities. If you're unsure whether something aligns, ask. We succeed when everyone pulls in the same direction.

## What This Means Day-to-Day (practical translation)

Based on the role spec and current feedback, here's what a good day/week looks like:

**Every morning:**
- Arrive, do a full floor walk before the clinic opens
- Run through the daily checklist — every room, every detail
- Brief the team on the day ahead

**Throughout the day:**
- Walk the floor — not sit at reception. Receptionists handle reception; you handle the practice.
- Spot things that are out of place, log them, fix them or delegate them
- Be the first to notice when something isn't right — don't wait to be told

**Weekly:**
- Submit flash report (Friday by 4pm) — accomplishments, challenges, next week's focus, asks
- Review and update the work board (Asana) — all tasks tracked, nothing forgotten
- Prep agenda items for our 1:1

**The standard we're aiming for:**
- Every room should be ready for a VIP patient at any moment
- Every piece of equipment should be in its right place, working, and clean
- Every task assigned should be completed or escalated — never forgotten
