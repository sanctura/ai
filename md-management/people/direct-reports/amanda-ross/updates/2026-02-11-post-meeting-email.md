**Subject: Today's Session — Summary & Expectations Reference**

---

Hi Amanda,

Thank you for today's session — I really appreciated your engagement and openness. I want to reiterate that this is about setting you up for success, not criticism. You're clearly committed and that matters.

**What you're doing well — and I want to see more of:**
- Flash report submitted on time, without a reminder
- Nursing roster delivered when needed
- Monday 8am meeting organised proactively when James was in town
- Your commitment is visible — first in, last out, and it's clear you care about the business

I want to use this email as a reference you can come back to, so here's a summary of what we discussed.

---

**Reception vs Floor**

The receptionists should be managing reception independently, backing each other up. Your place is on the floor — walking the practice, checking rooms, identifying issues, and working on projects or CQC items from an available room. You should only sit at reception as backup if both receptionists are unavailable. This applies every day, not only when James is in London.

**Daily Floor Walks & Snag List**

I'd like you to walk the floor every day and keep a running snag list. Inspect each room, think about what needs attention, and either fix it, delegate it, or log it. The standard we're aiming for: every room should be ready for a VIP patient at any moment. You can tackle rooms daily or pick a focus area for the week — whichever works best.

**Work Board (Asana)**

We'll be introducing a shared Asana work board as our task management platform. The purpose is to help you prioritise across multiple tasks, track progress, and make sure nothing gets forgotten. We'll review it together in our weekly 1:1s.

**Monday 8am Meetings (When James Visits)**

For future CEO visits, the process is:
- Confirm attendance with all staff the week before
- Get everyone who can practically attend there at 8am — only those on late coverage should be missing
- Send me a list ahead of time of who can and can't make it

His next visit is a few weeks out, so there's time to set this up properly.

**General Expectations**

These apply to all my direct reports:

1. **Attitude** — Show up positive. Your energy affects the whole team.
2. **Communication** — Keep me informed. No surprises. Share bad news early.
3. **Accountability** — Own your outcomes. Do what you say you'll do, by when you said you'd do it. If things change, tell me before deadlines slip.
4. **Continuous Improvement** — Look for ways to make things better. Question "the way we've always done it."
5. **Strategic Alignment** — Understand how your work connects to business priorities. If unsure, ask.

Attached are the expectations specific to your role as Practice Manager, as discussed in our meeting and for your reference. If anything is unclear or you disagree with anything, please bring this to my attention.

I'm genuinely optimistic about where we can take things. You have the work ethic — now it's about channelling it in the right direction.

Speak soon,
Grant
