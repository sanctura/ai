- Grant took on financial manager departure workload to shield Yaseen's project focus
- No performance data, 1:1 notes, or flash reports on file — visibility gap
- Kyle flagged in flash report (2026-02-13) needing to understand new financial structure and processes — Alida likely key contact for this
