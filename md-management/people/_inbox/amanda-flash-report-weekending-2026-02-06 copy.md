Please see this week’s flash report below.

**What I accomplished this week**

-   Onboarded new receptionist, Saba:
    
    -   Completed week one induction
-   Resolved heating issues in the clinic
-   Introduced rollout of the new invoicing system to the team:
    
    -   Nurses successfully completing treatment invoices
    -   Increased payments being taken in clinic
    -   Good progress ahead of going live over the next two weeks

**Challenges or blockers**

-   Busy week due to:
    
    -   New starter onboarding
    -   Dr Laporta being in clinic
-   This caused some delays to planned tasks, most notably:
    
    -   Progress on updating CQC policies
    -   Ongoing work with Dr Denning on these updates

**Top focus for next week**

-   Invoicing system go-live:
    
    -   Continue supporting the team to build confidence with invoicing and same-day payments
-   Ongoing training and support for Saba:
    
    -   Working closely with Lexee to bring her fully up to speed
-   Preparation for Clinical Governance meeting (Thursday):
    
    -   creating agenda
    -   Collating information
    -   Gathering team feedback
-   Continue work on remaining policy updates

**Anything I need from you**

-   Confirmation that you’re happy with the changes made to Maria Vega’s contract, from fixed term to permanent

Looking forward to welcoming you to the London Clinic
