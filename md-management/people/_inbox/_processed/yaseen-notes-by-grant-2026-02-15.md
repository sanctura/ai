**Some Background**
First off let's create some background information about Yaseen. Yaseen was originally the Chief Operating Officer he was hired bet about 12 months before me and he's been responsible for growing the clinic. He has hired people he has started the London clinic where he hired people, He has got several machines installed and set up various processes and spent quite a bit of time as the chief operating Officer. Since I've joined for over a year I've noticed a lot of inefficient processes and a lot of ways of work that I believe were working very well, so I've gotten involved in setting up meetings taking minutes looking at processes talking to people trying to really run operational things around the business that just weren't where they needed to be. After a bit of time doing this James the CEO started noticing I was a lot more equipped to run in this role than Yaseen was and he started picturing a new role for me where I could start looking after certain people that reported to Yaseen and looking after operations, and Yaseen could start focusing on new initiatives getting new machines and starting to look at where the business could add new products which have a lot of research and a lot of detail and something else seems very good at. So after much deliberation James with the Board of Directors decided to put me in the position of Managing Director, Yaseen would now report into me as the Chief Project Officer, and his old reports would now report into me and Yaseen would no longer have reports. Yaseen was not comfortable or happy about this change, and James gave him plenty time to work through it while talking to him but he just kept not understanding and needing more time and eventually James had to make the move and with the support of the board he made the move effectively the first of January 2025. I have now sat working with Yaseen trying to get him to focus on new projects, it has felt a little touch and go lucky as if he is potentially quiet quitting or whether he is needing more time to adjust to the role but it's taken about two or three weeks and I believe he's starting to step up and run in this role.
