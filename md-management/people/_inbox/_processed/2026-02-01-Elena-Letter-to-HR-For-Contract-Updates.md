Hi Lauren,

I hope you’re well.

I’m writing to ask for your help updating Dr Elena Hilton’s agreement for her upcoming six-month arrangement with Sanctura.

I’ve attached:

- the existing agreement (for reference), and
- a spreadsheet outlining the agreed working pattern and days for the new period.

The intention is to use the current contract as the base and update it to reflect the new agreement, including:

- the six-month term,
- revised working pattern and hours,
- agreed day rate, and
- any associated provisions needed for this arrangement.

This follows discussions between Elena, James, Ricardo and myself, and Ricardo has asked that we proceed with HR to formalise the updated contract.
Elena started on this agreement this week (2nd February)

Please let me know if you need anything further from me

Thanks very much for your support.

Best regards,
Grant
