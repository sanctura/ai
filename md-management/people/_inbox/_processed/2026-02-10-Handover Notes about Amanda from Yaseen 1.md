Dear Grant,

Please see open items which Amanda and I were dealing with for take over as requested. We have closed as many as we are able to and not commenced new items together recently.

- Employment contract for Maria Vega: this was previously agreed. Maria recently commenced 3 days per week with us. We are hoping to make this a more full-time arrangement. Maria V is an integrative oncology clinical nurse specialist who wants to do integrative work - to this end we will review periodically with Maria V to ensure her (and our) expectations are met. She runs a private practice as well with some services which we could charge for - and Maria V is promoting - this is being explored presently. Maria requested a few changes which we investigated and discussed and Amanda has drawn up a draft contract which I have commented on. Amanda will close off with Maria V. Maria V has also recently asked Amanda about possibly using our space to consult/treat from in return for additional time worked. We previously agreed to give her a 20% discount on 60 GBP/hour for room rental. This new request needs to be further explored.

- Periodic review of agreement with Maria Tam: Maria Tam works for us full-time but has permission from James to run her own private practice on the side as well. There is an expectation that it does not impact on her commitment to Sanctura which, to date, it has not. We also agreed to review it every 6 months or so to establish if Maria is still comfortable with the arrangement (and that it still works for us as well) or wishes to pursue private practice full-time - I think Amanda has had the conversation with her recently if I recall correctly.

- CQC policies: these were drawn up initially by Amanda and reviewed by an external expert. We made it through the inspection. As the practice has matured, some updates may be required. Amanda is busy with this review - it also needs to be reviewed annually/ad hoc as required.

- Snags and close off with contractor: this is almost finalised. There are 3 items which are being finalised but these are not major. I will follow up until concluded as part of the project work.

- Plant wall installation: Amanda is closing off with Plant Care - we have discussed the requirements.

- Lexee approached Amanda about an increase to her salary. She did not have any relevant experience when she started with us (07 July 2025) and an offer was extended and accepted accordingly. Feedback is that she has excelled. You and Amanda may want to take this into consideration when the annual increases come up.


Kind Regards,
Yaseen
