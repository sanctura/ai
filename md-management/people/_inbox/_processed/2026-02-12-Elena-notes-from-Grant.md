Since taking over the roll of MD, I (Grant), located Elena's contract and submitted a letter to our HR consultant to update her contract to relfect her new setup. (File: 2026-02-01-Elena-Letter-to-HR-For-Contract-Updates.md)
Elena was originally a part time workeer who also worked for the NHS, and since February took a 6 month sabbatical and joined us permanently about 4 days a week. Her schedule is iin file 2026-01-01-Elena-working-schedule.csv.

Elena has booked a strategy meeting with directors tomorrow and I pasted the content shes sent ahead of the meeting in 2025-02-12-Elena-mails-to-directors.md

Elena is a medical Doctor and our CEO Dr James Laporta has hired her as the medical officer to Sanctura to have a registered doctor at the practice.
James runs a private practice which is actually an integratice cancer clinic. This is different to Elena who comes from a more structure medical NHS Background.

James hopes for Elena is to help manage the practice in his vision, and be able to support him when he's not here and help the practice grow giving patients excellent treatment.
Elena does really care for patients and believes in supporting people and that we can make a difference here.

In our first two weeks we have hit some teething issues and I will supply my opinion and some comments of what's going on

- Elena is currently feelin quite stressed and anxious about the situation. She says she's losing sleep and looks stressed about how things are working.
- James if feeling very frustrated by Elena who seems to be constantly trying to change the way we're looking after patients, and not assisting him in the role he believes he's hired her
- Elena sees herself as very serious and very experiences doctor in the UK, and that she knows best how to deal with patients and constantly quotes how things are different in the UK, and that it's her reputation and she's the GMC registered doctor here. These are almost repeated in every point she makes and also strating to get on my nerves.
- Elena seems to think there's a lack of transparency and seem to keep interrupting or getting involved in James conversations with patients on the floor, which is causing James to be stressed and frustrated
- Elena also gets very suspicous if James meets with a patient that she doesn't know about, and ask about tranparency and seems to believe something untoward is happening
- Elena did not get invited to a business dinner, and thought this was really innapropriate
- Elena seems to feel left out if she's not involved in this. This isn't a social club or school. There is also a business that James and myself run that is bigger than just this clinic, and we are often involved in discussions about the bigger business that she should not be involved in. She needs to learn to respect that part of business.
- Elena is constantly worried that James sees patients late, or doesn't spend enough time with patients and this is going to tarnish our reputation and brand. She wasn't hired to be our brand ambassador, and James believe it's ok to run late and patient do understand that with specialist. I have also asked Elena to bring me complaints and we can tackle that if it's a real problem, but she should focus on her role.
- Elena has told me she's either written or ready to write her resignation. Like she's really frustrated and will leave if she gets pushed to far
- James has indicated that if Elena is unhappy she must leave.
- Wendy Denning is a consultant and integrative doctor that James has worked with more many years. She introduced James to another doctor he had a meeting with. Elena was all concerned why James should be meeting another doctor. Elena is full time but only works 4 days a week. James has many initiatives on the go and is free to meet whoever he wants. Elena needs to stay in her lane.

This is having real settling problems, and we may end up at a stage when Elena doesn't work and we're stuck without a medical doctor on site.
This will be very challenging, but we can't have someone who's trying to change what our CEO wants to build, or constantly questionin, second guessing and speculating.

I'm not sure that she understands her role clearly and what James needs her to be. She seems to think she comes in as a partner, as opposed to an employee.
I believe it's essential we have a clarity and expecatations sessions. Something along the lines of, here's your role and what we need. Accept it or move on.

These are my takes and opinions.
