This week was a big week for Amanda whereby i sat down and ran through her roles and expectations as planned.
It was a long session and she appeared to receive this direction and openness well. She also seemed to take some feedback on board and looked to be a good sign that she was stepping up.

She still continues to frustrate James, but i want to still give her the opportunity with feedback and direction.

**Thing she did well this week**
- Is not sitting at reception as requested.

**Concerning things she's done**
- I made it clear in our session that James examination bed in his office was a unnaceptable state as there is a big boxed whiteboard there and he cannot examing patients. That he's only here 12 days a month so we need to pay attention to these things and have his office in great shape. I told her to urgently remove this and ensure the area is clean and usable. This was tuesday morning. I waited until Wednesday evening to ask her why this was not done, and she explained she had tried but it was too heavy for her to move. I asked her why she didn't just communicate with me and she agreed and apologised. I then helped her move it.
- Second items was her flash report was not sent out this week. She was off on friday, and i didn't explicitly tell her what to do in thes cases. It's due by friday 4pm, and if she's off on friday she should obviously have sent it before she left. She also didn't really explain any handover info or things to look out for on her day off, which would have shown some forward thinking and pro-activity.
- On friday when James was leaving the office, he was looking for some critical medications he had ordered that he had to take with him. This has apparently been received and put into the pharmacy, but nobody communicated it. This is another concern and not the first time deliveries are received and just put somewhere without informing anyone.

**Actions i want to take**
- I need to address these with Amanda, but it's starting to become quite frustrating to address things daily and I believe is sending us down a very negative road.
- It needs to be clear she's missed the flash report, and she's missed sorting James room, and this is in my head a second strike. I'm thinking of strike three means documented conversation. Or maybe i should document it now.
- I need to make it clear that deliveries that are not expected (ordered stock for the nurses), should be communicated to the group so we can best direct it. Especially if it's medication which could be for a patient urgently, or be worth considerable value, or be expiring if it's not used in the right time frame.
