On Friday the 13th of February 2026, Dr Elena Hilton and Dr James Laporta decided to part ways and Elena has left the role of medical officer in the practice.

There seemed to be a disconnect where Dr Laporta had hired Elena to manage patient cases on his behalf and with the GMC registrations, but Elena was hyper concerned with medical governance and wanting to manage patients her way. Dr Laporta believed he had already hired Dr Wendy Denning with the focus on governance and CQC compliance, and that Elena needs to either raise specific concerns she has or trust the system and those put in responsible positions.

Elena has come of a NHS enfironment and was struggling in a private environment and both agreed to rather move on and Elena can go back to the NHS world she is comfortable and has a partner offer on the table and Sanctura will find another GMC registered doctor to reside in the clinic.

In the interim Dr Wendy Denning and Professor Justin Stebbing are shorter term candidates to step in and help fill the gap till a replacement is found.
