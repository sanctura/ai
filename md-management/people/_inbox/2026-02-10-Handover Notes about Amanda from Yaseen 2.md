Dear Grant,

I was working through some previous items to check and came across the below additional items. Amanda is aware of them and has attended/is attending to them.

- Clean bottom of lift shaft – this has been cleaned. Need to establish if satisfactory or if a repaint is needed.

- HBOT signage – this has been put up but images/graphics are required

- UK breathwork room to be converted to immersive sensory room - the instruction was not clear but Amanda has been adding/removing as clear instructions/requests are received. A few items are still outstanding.

- Shelving for store room and studio - to be ordered and installed (there were previous issues with the payment if I recall correctly.

- Glass board for consulting room - Amanda is procuring, previous board too heavy to be installed on dry wall as per handyman's feedback.

-  Water dispenser in waiting room - to source appropriate solution for the waiting area (challenges include aesthetics, no plumbing available, lack of functionality)

- Ventilation/cooling solution for HBOT room and pharmacy store - this will most likely entail a costly solution and needs planning. The pharmacy store can get hot - we placed a mobile fan/air-conditioner to control the temperature. If not successful, may need to consider a fixed a/c solution which could have high costs as there will likely be a long run between the wall unit and the compressor. Also, a location needs to be secured for the compressor and a suitable route for the run needs to be identified - this will entail landlord engagement and require approval, a specialist contractor will need to prepare drawings as well if the landlord uses the same approval mechanism used previously. This translates into long lead times as well. We also need to consider this for the HBOT room. The same considerations apply as for the pharmacy store room. Amanda has approached the contractor previously.

-  Daily walk through of UK unit (list has been implemented and updated since, Amanda can share updated list. A daily check needs to be conducted to ensure standards are met.) Below are some of the types of items on the daily check list.

o   books are the right way around and in the right direction

o   areas are clean and appropriately arranged (furniture, no tripping hazards, etc)

o   flowers in relevant locations

o   snacks and water replenished

o   display cabinets full and neat

o   bins cleaned

o   lights and a/c's on

o   music on

o   sound bowl

o   cables neat

o   hand soap, tissues and hand towels replenished

o   bathrooms clean and sufficient hand towels and toilet paper


Kind Regards,
Yaseen
