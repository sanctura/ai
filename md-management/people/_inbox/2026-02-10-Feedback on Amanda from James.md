James says Amanda has been tasked with various activities over time that she keeps forgetting.
He says he has asked and reminded her about specific things, and she forgets and always has a "oopsie" kind of reponse when reminded.

There are various things around the office that are not being looked after effectively enough and we really want a receptionist

- Deliveries are sometimes not managed well like a package for Elena, or me receiving my Christmas gift from our head office which i found month later when arriving at the office.
- POlycom in the private patient suite is signed in with Amanda's account, should use generic, and is it even working and plugged in
- Fridge in the private patient should be stocked with drinks and snacks
- IN the pharmacy expensive hyperthermia equipment is just sitting on top of crytals not looking packed away correctly/effectively. This carries a large monetary value
- Crystals sitting in the pharmacy are supposed to be placed around the office and this was apparently requested but just not done
- Incense sitting in the pharmacy, shoudl this be in a pharmacy or storage
- Display in the window is lacking stock that can be there and should have more attention placed to it as it could be a sales driver. She could nomincate someone like new receptionist Saba to own the display window and make it her thing - that's a suggestion
- Stock places in the pharmacy should have it's sample stickers removed
- Travel bags should be in storage, not the pharmacy
- The HBOT room needs an extraction fan that could go into the laser room
- There are bigger rocks around that office that light up, at the bottom of the stairs that was supposed to be lit up and was requested, but just hasn't been done
- The practice manager should be working the floor daily doing a check list of things that needs to be done right, as well as building snag list with things that are out of place. Inspect each room and also think what needs to happen to improve the room. Rooms could be tackled every day or become a topic for the week. What can we do here?
- private patient suite has a chair with build in charging cables for devices that has not been setup properly

The CEO is quite frutrated by the lack of attention, the forgetfulness when things are asked and Amanda's approach to setting up a michelin star level practice.
He believes we may have the wrong person here, but respects Grant's process and will support Grant in setting expectations, giving Amanda clear instructions and setting up Amanda for success so we can have her delivery on all fronts.

the CEO also does acknowledge Amanda's commitment towards putting in a lot of effort, caring about the practice, working long hours etc.
