Hi Jolene,
Thanks so much for coming back to me.

Thank you for sending over the Master Services Level Agreement. We’re very much looking forward to getting our partnership underway and setting ourselves up for a strong 2026.

We’ve reviewed the document and have some proposed amendments. The primary goal of these changes is to ensure the SLA accurately reflects the proposed 90-day Phase 1 pilot engagement, which is focused on building a strong strategic foundation and establishing operational confidence.

We believe these adjustments will create a fair and clear framework that protects both parties and positions our partnership for long-term success.

Below is a summary of the key areas we’d like to amend:

---

### **1. Agreement Term & Duration (Clause 3)**

The current draft is structured as a 12-month agreement with restrictive cancellation terms. To align it with our agreed pilot model, we propose replacing the existing Clause 3 with language that defines a fixed 90-day term with a clear and simple exit mechanism. This provides confidence on both sides, with a defined period to establish a successful working relationship before committing to a longer-term engagement.

**Proposed Replacement for Clause 3:**

> **3. APPOINTMENT & DURATION**
> **3.1 Appointment:** The Client appoints Shift One to supply the Services, and Shift One accepts this appointment.
> **3.2 Services:** Shift One will provide the Services as described in the Proposal (Appendix B).
> **3.3 Initial Pilot Period:** This Agreement shall commence on **12 January 2026** (the “Commencement Date”) and will run on a calendar-month basis, with fees for January 2026 prorated accordingly. The Initial Pilot Period shall continue through to **31 March 2026**, inclusive.
> **3.4 Termination:** This Agreement shall automatically terminate at the conclusion of the Initial Pilot Period without the need for notice from either party.
> **3.5 Termination for Convenience:** During the Initial Pilot Period, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing the other party with thirty (30) days’ written notice.
> **3.6 Future Engagement:** Prior to the conclusion of the Initial Pilot Period, the Parties may, by mutual written agreement, elect to enter into a new Service Level Agreement. The terms, scope, and fees for any such future engagement shall be negotiated in good faith. This Agreement shall not automatically renew. If no new agreement is signed, the engagement may continue on a month-to-month basis with a thirty (30) day notice period for cancellation by either party.

### **2. Personal Liability (Clause 8.6)**

Clause 8.6 requires a personal suretyship from the director signing the agreement. This is not a standard term for a B2B engagement of this nature and introduces a level of personal risk we are not able to accept.

* **Request:** Removal of Clause 8.6 in its entirety.

---

### **3. Fees, Billing & Scope Flexibility (Clause 4)**

To ensure fairness and flexibility during the pilot phase, we request the following adjustments:

* **Prorated First Invoice:** As the engagement begins on **12 January 2026**, please confirm that the first invoice will be prorated accordingly.
* **No Automatic Fee Increases:** Clause 4.6 (the 10% annual increase) should not apply automatically. Any future fee adjustments should be discussed and agreed upon based on performance, value delivered, and strategic alignment.
* **Service Flexibility During Pilot:** To allow agility during the Initial Pilot Period, we propose that the one-month notice for removing services (Clause 4.12) and the six-month commitment for new services (Clause 4.13) do not apply during this phase.

---

### **4. Intellectual Property & Asset Ownership (Clause 7)**

It is critical for Sanctura to maintain continuity and ownership of assets created during the engagement.

* **Source Files (Clause 7.1.1):** Upon full payment for the relevant services, ownership of all final **and** source/working files (including, but not limited to, Figma and Adobe assets) created for Sanctura should transfer to Sanctura without an additional handover fee.
* **Stock Assets (Clause 7.5.3):** The current clause states that Sanctura’s right to use licensed assets ceases upon termination. This presents a material business risk, as it could require the sudden removal of assets from live websites or active advertising campaigns. We request that Sanctura retains a perpetual, royalty-free licence to use any stock assets procured by Shift One for our deliverables, even after termination. If third-party licensing restrictions prevent this, please provide a full list of such assets and their sources so we can arrange direct licensing upon off-boarding if required.

We feel these amendments are reasonable and ensure the legal agreement reflects the spirit and structure of the partnership we discussed. We are, of course, very happy to discuss any of these points further.

We look forward to your feedback.

Kind regards,
