Hi Dylan,

I’m pleased to confirm that we have Board support to move forward with Shift One.

We’d like to proceed with a 90-day Phase 1 engagement, aligned to the objectives we discussed, with the explicit intention of using this period to establish strategic clarity, strong governance, and operational confidence in the partnership.

Our goal at the end of the 90 days is to be able to say, with confidence:
“We are ready to scale marketing investment with this partner.”

For Phase 1, our focus would be on:

Senior marketing leadership and strategic direction

Clear positioning, priority markets, and channel strategy

Strong reporting, cadence, and control

Measured execution to demonstrate capability and momentum, rather than aggressive scale

Based on the success of Phase 1, we would then look to firm up Phase 2, selectively increasing services and investment (SEO scale, paid media, content, video, etc.) in line with what the agreed strategy supports.

As discussed, we’re comfortable keeping Phase 1 tightly defined, with flexibility to cherry-pick and sequence additional elements once we’ve completed the initial 90-day period.

Let’s align on next steps to finalise the Phase 1 scope, commercials, and start date. Ideally, we’d like to get underway in January and set the year up strongly.

Enjoy your time off. When you’re able, it would be great to confirm availability and next steps so we can lock in a January start and hit the ground running in 2026.

Best Regards,
Grant
