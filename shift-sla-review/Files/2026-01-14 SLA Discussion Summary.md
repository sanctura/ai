# Meeting Reference: SLA Amendment Discussion Points
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Meeting with:** Shift One Digital CEO

---

## 1. Agreement Term (Clause 3) - Convert to 90-Day Pilot
- **Issue:** Current SLA is 12-month with restrictive cancellation
- **Ask:** Replace with fixed 90-day pilot (12 Jan - 31 Mar 2026)
- **Key terms:** Auto-terminate at end of pilot, 30-day termination for convenience, month-to-month continuation option afterward

---

## 2. Personal Liability (Clause 8.6) - Remove Entirely
- **Issue:** Requires personal suretyship from signing director
- **Ask:** Full removal - not standard for B2B engagements of this nature

---

## 3. Fees & Flexibility (Clause 4) - Three Sub-Points

| Item | Clause | Ask |
|------|--------|-----|
| Prorated January invoice | - | Confirm billing from 12 Jan only |
| No auto fee increases | 4.6 | Remove 10% annual escalation |
| Service flexibility | 4.12, 4.13 | Waive 1-month removal notice & 6-month new service lock-in during pilot |

---

## 4. IP & Asset Ownership (Clause 7) - Two Sub-Points
- **Source Files (7.1.1):** Full ownership transfer (including Figma/Adobe source files) upon payment - no extra handover fee
- **Stock Assets (7.5.3):** Perpetual licence to use procured stock assets after termination, OR provide a list of restricted assets so Sanctura can arrange direct licensing

---

## Framing

These amendments align the legal document with the spirit of the agreed 90-day pilot - low-risk, relationship-building phase before longer commitment.
