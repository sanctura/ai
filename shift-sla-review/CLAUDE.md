# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a document management repository for negotiating a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between Sanctura (a healthcare organization) and Shift One Digital (a marketing agency) for a 90-day pilot marketing engagement starting January 2026.

## Key Documents

- **Files/Sanctura x S1 SLA.pdf** - Master SLA from Shift One Digital (the document being negotiated)
- **Files/ShiftOne - Proposal.pdf** - Original marketing proposal from Shift One
- **Files/initial acceptance correspondance.txt** - Email confirming board approval for 90-day Phase 1 engagement
- **Files/Sanctura Draft Digital Marketing Budget 2026 _ S1 - ZAR.xlsx** - Marketing budget spreadsheet
- **sla-feedback.md** - Draft amendment request email to Shift One

## Core Negotiation Points

When working with SLA amendments, the key areas of concern are:

1. **Term & Duration** - Converting 12-month agreement to 90-day pilot with simple exit mechanism
2. **Personal Liability** - Removing director suretyship requirement (Clause 8.6)
3. **Fees & Flexibility** - Prorated invoicing, no automatic fee increases, service flexibility during pilot
4. **IP & Asset Ownership** - Source file ownership and perpetual stock asset licensing

## Context

The `Files/initial acceptance correspondance.txt` establishes the original intent for a flexible 90-day pilot, which is central to all amendment requests.
