## Clarifications Agreed

1. **4-month term rationale:** Month 1 is strategic planning/foundation; Months 2-4 are the actual 90-day execution phase.

2. **Termination flexibility:** Shift ONE requires commitment during trial for resource planning. Post-trial exit is straightforward with 1 month notice.

3. **Source files:** Standard industry practice - agencies retain working files. All final rendered deliverables belong to client.

## Conclusion

**Recommendation:** Proceed to sign.

All original concerns have been addressed through either direct changes or mutually agreed compromises that are fair to both parties.
