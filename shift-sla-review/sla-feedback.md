Subject: Feedback and Amendments for Sanctura x Shift One SLA

Hi Dylan,

Hope you’re well.

Thanks for sending over the Master Services Level Agreement. We’re very much looking forward to getting our partnership underway and setting ourselves up for a strong 2026.

We’ve reviewed the document and have some proposed amendments. The primary goal of these changes is to ensure the SLA accurately reflects the 90-day "Phase 1" pilot engagement we've discussed, which is focused on building a strong strategic foundation and operational confidence.

We believe these adjustments will create a fair and clear framework that protects both parties and sets our partnership up for long-term success.

Here is a summary of the key areas we’d like to amend:

---

### **1. Agreement Term & Duration (Clause 3)**

The current draft is structured as a 12-month agreement with restrictive cancellation terms. To align it with our agreed-upon pilot model, we propose replacing the existing Clause 3 with language that defines a fixed 90-day term with a clear and simple exit mechanism. This gives us the confidence to proceed, knowing we have a defined period to establish a successful working relationship before committing to a longer-term engagement.

**Proposed Replacement for Clause 3:**

> **3. APPOINTMENT & DURATION**
>
> **3.1 Appointment:** The Client appoints Shift ONE to supply the Services, and Shift ONE accepts this appointment.
>
> **3.2 Services:** Shift ONE will provide the Services as described in the Proposal (Appendix B).
>
> **3.3 Initial Pilot Period:** This Agreement shall commence on **12 January 2026** ("the Commencement Date") and will continue for a fixed period of ninety (90) days ("the Initial Pilot Period"), concluding on **11 April 2026**.
>
> **3.4 Termination:** This Agreement shall automatically terminate at the conclusion of the Initial Pilot Period without the need for notice from either party.
>
> **3.5 Termination for Convenience:** During the Initial Pilot Period, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause by providing the other party with thirty (30) days' written notice.
>
> **3.6 Future Engagement:** Prior to the conclusion of the Initial Pilot Period, the Parties may, by mutual written agreement, elect to enter into a new Service Level Agreement. The terms, scope, and fees for any such future engagement shall be negotiated in good faith. This Agreement shall not automatically renew. If no new agreement is signed, the engagement may continue on a month-to-month basis with a 30-day notice period for cancellation by either party.

### **2. Personal Liability (Clause 8.6)**

Clause 8.6 requires a personal suretyship from the director signing the agreement. This isn't a standard term for a B2B engagement of this nature and introduces a level of personal risk we are not able to accept.

*   **Request:** Please remove Clause 8.6 entirely.

---

### **3. Fees, Billing, & Scope Flexibility (Clause 4)**

To ensure fairness and flexibility during the pilot, we request the following adjustments:

*   **Prorated First Invoice:** As we are starting on **Jan 12, 2026**, please confirm the first invoice will be prorated accordingly.
*   **No Automatic Fee Increases:** Clause 4.6 (10% annual increase) should not be automatic. Any future fee adjustments should be a point of discussion based on strategy, value delivered, and mutual agreement.
*   **Flexibility on Services:** To allow us to be agile during the pilot, we propose that the one-month notice for removing services (4.12) and the six-month commitment for new services (4.13) do not apply during the Initial Pilot Period.

---

### **4. Intellectual Property & Asset Ownership (Clause 7)**

It is critical that we have full continuity and ownership of the assets created for us during our engagement.

*   **Source Files (7.1.1):** We propose that upon full payment for the relevant services, ownership of all final **and** source/working files (e.g., Figma, Adobe assets, etc.) for deliverables created for us will be transferred to Sanctura without an additional handover fee.
*   **Stock Assets (7.5.3):** The clause stating our right to use licensed assets ceases upon termination presents a significant business risk. We cannot be in a position where we have to suddenly replace essential images on our website or in our ad campaigns. We request that Sanctura retains a perpetual, royalty-free license to use any stock assets procured by Shift ONE for our deliverables, even after the termination of the agreement. If this is not possible due to third-party licensing restrictions, please provide a list of all such assets and their source, so we can arrange to purchase our own licenses directly upon off-boarding if needed.

We feel these amendments are reasonable and align the legal agreement with the spirit of the partnership we discussed. We are, of course, happy to discuss any of these points further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Grant
