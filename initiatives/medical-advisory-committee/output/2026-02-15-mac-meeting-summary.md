**Subject:** Medical Advisory Committee – Summary of Discussion (13 February 2026)

---

Hi All,

Thank you to those who joined the meeting at Sanctura on Friday 13th February. I wanted to follow up with a summary of what was discussed and the direction we are looking to take.

## Forming a Medical Advisory Committee

The central topic of our meeting was the proposal to establish a **Medical Advisory Committee (MAC)** for Sanctura's UK operations. The purpose of this committee is to:

- Review business initiatives from a medical and governance perspective
- Help guide Sanctura on its current position, new objectives, and strategic direction
- Evaluate proposals before they are escalated to the corporate board for decision

The MAC would operate **separately from the corporate board**, with its own distinct mandate focused on clinical governance and medical strategy. When the committee supports an initiative, it would put forward a formal proposal to the board.

## Proposed Membership

The following individuals were discussed as potential committee members:

- Dr Wendy Denning
- Mohammed Desai
- Dr James Laporta
- Professor Justin Stebbing
- Aida Yousefi

As a next step, we need to agree on the final list of members and then approach each person individually to confirm their interest and availability.

## Key Topics & Initiatives

A number of initiatives were identified as items the committee would review and advise on:

**UK Focus**
- Clinical governance framework and advisory board structure
- Home-based care model, including a potential joint venture with Lloyds
- Screening services
- Real-World Evidence (RWE) strategy

**International Expansion**
- Portugal – potential new clinic
- UAE – Virtue partnership
- Blueprint for standardising new clinic openings

**South Africa (secondary phase)**
- ChemoLab integration
- Specials manufacturing feasibility (including cannabis)
- Home-based care model for RSA

Our initial focus will be on the UK, with South Africa to follow as a secondary phase, potentially under a separate committee.

## Next Steps

1. **Agree on committee members** – Please review the proposed list above and share any thoughts on additions or changes
2. **Approach members individually** – Once we have alignment, we can reach out to each proposed member to confirm their participation
3. **Terms of reference** – Define meeting frequency, decision-making process, roles (Chair, administration), and scope
4. **Prioritise initiatives** – Agree on which items the committee should tackle first
5. **Set a date** – Target a date for the first formal committee meeting

Please share any feedback or suggestions. Happy to set up a call to discuss further if that would be useful.

Kind regards,
Grant Merwitz
Managing Director, Sanctura
