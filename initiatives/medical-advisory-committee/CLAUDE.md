# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a planning repository for proposing a Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) for Sanctura, an integrative cancer care company. The MAC will govern Sanctura's UK clinic operations, review business initiatives from a medical perspective, and submit proposals to the corporate board. This is a documentation/planning project — there is no code, build system, or tests.

## Repository Structure

- **background/** — Source material: company profile and initial meeting notes/prompt from Dr Laporta
- **information-base/** — Structured reference files (numbered 01–05) covering committee overview, proposed members, agenda items, company context, and open questions
- **output/** — Deliverables such as emails and proposals, prefixed with date stamps (`yyyy-mm-dd`)

## Conventions

- All documents are Markdown
- Output files must be named with a leading date stamp: `yyyy-mm-dd-description.md`
- Information base files are numbered for reading order (`01-`, `02-`, etc.)
- British English spelling (e.g. "standardise", "specialise", "licence")

## Key Context

- Sanctura Holdings (UK) is owned 50/50 by Dr James Laporta and Capricorn Capital
- The UK clinic (Sanctura Ltd) is CQC-licensed and operational in London
- The MAC is separate from the corporate board — it advises and escalates proposals upward
- UK is the primary focus; a South Africa committee may follow as a secondary phase
- Proposed MAC members: Dr Wendy Denning, Mohammed Desai, Dr James Laporta, Professor Justin Stebbing, Aida Yousefi
- Grant Merwitz is Managing Director and the primary author of output documents
