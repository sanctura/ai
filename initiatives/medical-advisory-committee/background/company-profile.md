# **Company Overview: Sanctura**

**Empowering Cancer Patients through Integrative Excellence**

Sanctura is an international healthcare brand specializing in integrative cancer care. By combining conventional oncology with evidence-based supportive therapies, Sanctura provides a holistic roadmap for patients navigating their cancer journey.

## **1. Our Origins: From Private Practice to Global Brand**

The Sanctura story began with the clinical work of **Dr. James Laporta**, who originally operated a private practice in South Africa while traveling to London as a Naturopath.

The transition from a solo practice to a corporate entity was sparked by **Patrick Snelgar**, a patient who experienced the impact of Dr. Laporta’s model firsthand. Recognizing the global potential for this integrative approach, Snelgar, through his investment firm **Capricorn Capital**, partnered with Dr. Laporta to formalize and scale the vision.

## **2. Corporate Structure & Governance**

Sanctura is built on a robust, cross-border legal framework designed for international growth:

* **Sanctura Holdings (UK):** The parent company, owned 50% by Dr. James Laporta and 50% by Capricorn Capital.
* **Sanctura Ltd (UK):** Operates the London clinic.
* **St. Raphael (Pty) Ltd & Dr. James Laporta Inc (SA):** Jointly manage the operational and medical aspects of the Cape Town clinic.
