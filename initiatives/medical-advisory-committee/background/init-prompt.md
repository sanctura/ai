Our CEO Dr James Laporta wants to form a Medical Advisory Committee in the UK. This will act as a committee that is able to review business initiatives from a medical and governance perspective, and help guide Sanctura on its current state, it's new objectives and pick the right direction and proposals.

A similar board could follow in Cape Town, but the initial focus is on the UK.

A meeting took place at Sanctura on Friday 13th February with Aida Yousefi where various items were discussed and the proposal of forming a committee with the following people were discussed:
- Aida Yousefi
- Professor Justin Stebbing
- Mohammed Desai
- Dr Wendy Denning
- Dr James Laporta

This committee would then be able to discuss various initiatives, and when projects, initiatives or new lines of business needed to move forward it could then put a proposal through the the corporate board. So the committee would operate seperately to the corporate board and have a different mandate but an important one regards to Sanctura continued governance and future.

Here are some of the notes Dr Laporta took in the meeting which included some taslks of South Africa committee which would be secondary. ON here are some of the backlog items that the committee would discuss.
