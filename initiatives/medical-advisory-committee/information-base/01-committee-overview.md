# Committee Overview

## Purpose

The Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) is a proposed governance body for Sanctura's UK operations. It will review business initiatives from a medical and governance perspective, helping guide Sanctura on its current state, new objectives, and strategic direction.

## Mandate

- Review and advise on clinical and business initiatives
- Provide medical governance oversight for UK operations
- Evaluate new proposals before they are escalated to the corporate board
- Guide strategic direction on healthcare compliance, expansion, and partnerships

## Relationship to Corporate Board

The MAC operates **separately** from the Sanctura corporate board. It has a distinct mandate focused on medical governance and clinical strategy. When projects, initiatives, or new lines of business need to move forward, the MAC puts a proposal through to the corporate board for final approval.

**Flow:** Initiative → MAC Review & Recommendation → Corporate Board Decision
