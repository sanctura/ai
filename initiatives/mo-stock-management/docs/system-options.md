**Status**: Partially adopted

**What Xero offers for inventory**:
- Basic inventory tracking (tracked vs untracked items)
- Purchase orders
- Stock quantity tracking
- Cost of goods sold reporting
- Integration with invoicing and billing

**Current gaps**:
- Purchase unit prices not consistently recorded
- No reorder point/level alerts

- Adoption by staff has been inconsistent

## Option 1: Xero Add-ons / Integrations

### Inventory Management Plugins for Xero

Several third-party apps integrate with Xero to extend inventory capabilities:

- **DEAR Inventory (Cin7 Core)** - Full inventory management with batch tracking, reorder points, multi-location support
- **Unleashed** - Advanced inventory with batch/expiry tracking, demand forecasting
- **TradeGecko (QuickBooks Commerce)** - Inventory and order management (note: now part of Intuit)
- **Sortly** - Visual inventory management, barcode scanning, low stock alerts
- **inFlow Inventory** - Stock management with reorder points, reporting

**Pros**: Integrates with existing Xero setup, maintains current accounting workflows
**Cons**: Additional subscription cost, may not cover pharmacy-specific regulatory needs

## Option 2: Pharmacy-Specific Software

Purpose-built systems for medicine and pharmacy management in the UK:

- **Positive Solutions (Cegedim)** - UK pharmacy management, PMR system
- **PharmOutcomes** - Pharmacy services management
- **Titan PMR** - Patient medication record system

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended to Explore)

Use Xero for financial/accounting + a dedicated inventory tool for stock management:

1. **Xero** - Continues to handle invoicing, billing, purchase orders, financial reporting
2. **Inventory plugin (e.g., Cin7/DEAR or Unleashed)** - Handles stock levels, reorder alerts, batch tracking, expiry dates
3. **Simple SOP document** - Defines the process for nurses/staff to follow

**Key features to look for**:
- Reorder point alerts (automatic notification when stock drops below threshold)
- Batch number and expiry date tracking
- Barcode/QR code scanning for stock takes
- Supplier management and purchase order workflows
- Reporting (stock value, turnover, wastage)
- Mobile/tablet access for nurses doing stock takes
- Xero integration for seamless accounting
