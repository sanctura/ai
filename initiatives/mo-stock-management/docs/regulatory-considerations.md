# Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

## UK Import Regulations for Health Products

### 1. Oral Supplements & Vitamins

- Generally classified as **food supplements** under UK food law
- Regulated by the **Food Standards Agency (FSA)**
- Must comply with the **Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003**
- Labelling must meet UK requirements (English language, ingredients, dosage)
- No import licence typically required, but must meet safety standards
- **Novel foods** may require separate authorisation

### 2. IV Medications & Injectables

- Likely classified as **medicinal products** under the **Human Medicines Regulations 2012**
- Regulated by the **MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency)**
- Key requirements:
  - **Wholesale Dealer's Licence (WDL)** - required to distribute medicines
  - **Manufacturer's/Importer's Licence (MIA)** - required to import medicines into the UK
  - Products must have UK Marketing Authorisation or be sourced under the **"specials" scheme** for unlicensed medicines
- Many of the German-sourced IV products (Pascoe, Burghardt, Kohler) may not have UK marketing authorisation and would need to be imported as **unlicensed specials**

### 3. Items Requiring Special Attention

| Item | Concern | Regulatory Body |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Modafinil | Schedule 4 Controlled Drug (POM) | MHRA / Home Office |
| Ceftriaxone | Prescription-only antibiotic | MHRA |
| Promethazine | Prescription-only medicine | MHRA |
| Cordarone X | Prescription-only cardiac medication | MHRA |
| Solu-Cortef | Prescription-only corticosteroid | MHRA |
| Artesunate | Antimalarial, unlicensed in UK | MHRA (specials) |
| Nebido | Testosterone, controlled substance | MHRA / Home Office |
| Iscador | Mistletoe extract, unlicensed | MHRA (specials) |

### 4. Brexit Implications

- UK no longer automatically recognises EU marketing authorisations
- Separate UK import procedures now apply
- May need to source from UK-based wholesalers where possible
- Batch testing/release may need to occur in the UK

## Licensing Requirements to Investigate

- [ ] Does the practice hold or need a **Wholesale Dealer's Licence**?
- [ ] Does the practice need a **Manufacturer's/Importer's Licence** for the IV products?
- [ ] Are the German IV products being sourced through a licensed UK **specials importer**?
- [ ] Is there a **Responsible Person** designated for medicines management?
- [ ] Are controlled drugs (Modafinil, Nebido) stored and managed per Home Office requirements?
- [ ] Is there a **Standard Operating Procedure** for receiving, storing, and dispensing medications?

## Storage & Handling

- Temperature-controlled storage requirements for many IV products
- Expiry date management critical for medications
- Controlled drugs require separate locked storage and registers
- Proper waste disposal procedures for expired/unused medications

## Record Keeping

- Purchase records must be maintained for all medicines
- Batch numbers and expiry dates should be recorded
- Dispensing records for prescription-only medicines
- Controlled drug register entries
