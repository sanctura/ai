Currently in our UK practice we are managing stock in our pharmacy and we are seeking a better and more efficient way to manage how we are both ordering new supplies for stock, and how we are working with suppliers to order stocks at certain levels, And how we are leveraging our accounting package or inventory management software to do so. In addition we are also looking at regulation and governance around how we are able to import stock into the UK, and what licensing or regulations affect the stock we need which is often oral vitamins and supplements that are not considered medications, but there are also Is intravenous vitamin infusions that are potentially considered medications in the UK and subject to import licensing.

Both MO and myself have inherited a system that's currently working in the practice Comm We have nurses managing the stock and doing stock takes periodically and ordering on demand, and we have a accounting package called Zero which we are managing stock levels and purchase orders but the adoption of this product has not been fully manage dwell. We are potentially looking for a plug in in zero that will help us with inventory management, as well as a potential product that would be more specific to pharmacy level medicine management, In addition to defining a process of how to utilize the system how to stock and how we managing our pharmacy and the business needs and requirements.

In the same folder as this file we have placed our last export of inventory from zero as a reference to what inventory we currently have in stock.
