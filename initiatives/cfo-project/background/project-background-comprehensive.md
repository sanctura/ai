## 2. The Situation

### What Happened

Alida Wiese, the long-tenured Financial Manager, resigned on **26 January 2026** with a last day of **23 February 2026**. She held institutional knowledge across all 7 entities and was the single point of contact for invoicing, supplier payments, payroll data, compliance, banking operations, and financial reporting.

### The Response

A structured transition plan was executed across four weeks:

| Phase | Period | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Week 1** (26 Jan - 1 Feb) | Mobilisation | Xero live for invoicing (28 Jan), billing manual drafted, stakeholders briefed |
| **Week 2** (3-7 Feb) | Training & Go-Live | Staff trained on invoicing, go-live Friday 7 Feb |
| **Week 3** (10-14 Feb) | Stabilisation | Kyle and Amanda running teams, Alida ~30% support |
| **Week 4** (17-23 Feb) | Independence | Teams fully independent, Alida edge cases only, final handover |

### Replacement Resource

**Ronald Mushonga** was engaged as Fractional CFO via Clearshell Management Solutions:

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Contract period | 9 February 2026 - 9 June 2026 |
| Commitment | 40 hours/week |
| Reports to | Grant Merwitz (MD) |
| Xero scope | 2 SA orgs (Saint Raphael, Inc) + 1 UK org (Sanctura Ltd) |
| Management accounts | By 7th working day of each month |
| Key limitation | **No Investec banking access** - cannot load or release payments |
| Provider contact | Must liaise with Grant before initiating direct contact with service providers |

---

## 3. Key People

### Leadership

| Name | Role | Financial Responsibilities |
|------|------|--------------------------|
| **James La Porta** | CEO & Lead Doctor | Only Level 4 Investec access (SARS payment releases), final approvals |

## 4. External Service Providers

| Provider | Services | Entities | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Inaura** | Payroll, PAYE, VAT, income tax, financial statements | SA entities | Active - **planned phase-out** to Bokelman or equivalent (Ronald facilitating, Mar-Jun) |
| **Kinari / Capricorn Capital Services** | Banking, payroll, PAYE, financial statements, full Holdings management | UK entities | Active - continuing |
| **Imperium Registrations (Theo)** | Annual returns, UBO submissions, secretarial, CIPC | SA entities | Active |
| **Atlantic Trust** | Trust administration, payment execution | James's Trust | Active - Bokelman transition **deferred** |
| **Intersure (Brian/Patricia)** | Insurance broker | SA entities | Active |

| **Optiworx** | HR policies and contracts | SA entities | Active - files were with Alida |
| **GPE** | UK rental management | Sanctura Ltd | Active |
| **TAFTS** | Equipment financing | Inc/Saint Raphael | Active (hypothermia baths, ultrasound) |
| **AON** | James personal insurance | Personal | Relationship handover needed |

### Provider Transition Plan

---

## 5. Banking & Payment Controls

### Accounts

| Bank | Entity | Region |
|------|--------|--------|
| Investec | James La Porta Inc, Saint Raphael | SA |
| Barclays | Sanctura Ltd (debit + 2 credit cards) | UK |
| Revolut | Sanctura Ltd (KYC pending) | UK |

### Payment Workflow (Current)

Ronald has no banking access. The payment process is:

```
1. Ronald prepares payment schedules (reconciles invoices, prepares details)
2. Grant loads payments into Investec
3. Grant or Yaseen releases non-SARS payments
4. James releases SARS payments only (VAT, Income Tax) - no delegation possible
```

### Access Levels (Investec)

| Person | Level | Can Do |
|--------|-------|--------|
| James | Level 4 | Release ALL payments including SARS, close accounts |
| Yaseen | Lower | Load payments, release non-SARS |
| Grant | Lower | Load payments, release non-SARS |

**Single point of failure:** James is the only person who can release SARS payments. No backup exists.

---

## 6. Invoicing Transformation (Completed Go-Live)

### The Change

Moved from centralised invoicing (Alida creating all invoices retrospectively) to **decentralised invoicing at point of service**.

### The Model

| Role | Invoices | Responsibility |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Nurses** | IVs, treatments, medications | Invoice at point of delivery |
| **Reception** | Consultations, supplements | Invoice and collect payment |
| **Reception** | Patient statement | Print at patient exit |
| **Kyle/Amanda** | Process ownership | Governance, training, compliance - not execution |
| **Ronald** | Audit & quality control | Weekly invoice accuracy checks |

### What's Been Done

- **28 January:** Xero went live for invoicing and quoting
- **Week 1:** Xero configured, templates set up, users added, billing manual drafted
- **Week 2:** Staff trained (reception and nurses), dry run completed
- **7 February:** Go-live - staff creating real invoices
- **CPT and UK went live simultaneously** - not sequentially

### Three-Phase Billing Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Survival/Simplify** | Basic codes, laminated checklist, invoices presentable for medical aid | CURRENT - operational |
| **Phase 2: Optimise** | Improve pricing, reduce missed charges, add audit rules, billing baskets/bundles | Next |
| **Phase 3: Interface/Automation** | CRM integration, Xero API/marketplace apps | Future |

### Medical Aid Position

- Sanctura does **not** bill medical aid directly
- Patients pay Sanctura, then reclaim independently
- Sanctura provides compliant invoices and support documentation

### Debt Collection Escalation

| Stage | Owner | Scenario |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Initial contact | Ronald | Pull debtors list, communicate with debtors |
| Product/service dispute | Kyle (SA) / Amanda (UK) | "I didn't receive this" - investigate |
| Service explanation | Doctor | "What is this charge?" - explain clinical service |
| Debt support/hardship | Exco | Review and decide on payment arrangements |

---

## 7. Systems & Tools

| System | Purpose | Users |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Xero** (3 orgs) | Accounting, invoicing, quoting, bank reconciliation | Ronald, Kyle, Amanda, nurses, reception |
| **Healthbridge** | Patient medical billing (Inc) | Candice has some experience |
| **Investec Online** | SA banking (Inc, Saint Raphael) | James, Yaseen, Grant |
| **Barclays Online** | UK banking (Sanctura Ltd) | Kinari, Grant |
| **SARS eFiling** | Tax submissions | Inaura |
| **CIPC** | Company returns, UBO | Imperium |
