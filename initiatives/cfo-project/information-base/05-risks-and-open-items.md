|---|------|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **SARS payment release** - James is only Level 4 signatory | High | None | **HIGH** |
| 2 | **Knowledge loss post-Alida** - undocumented processes | High | 13-day overlap with Ronald, documentation push | MEDIUM |
| 3 | **Contract cliff (9 Jun)** - no permanent replacement plan | High | Phase 3 recommendation report, recruitment planning | MEDIUM |
| 4 | **Inaura service quality** - historical concerns | Medium | Planned transition to Bokelman (Mar-Jun) | MEDIUM |
| 5 | **Invoicing errors** - new decentralised model | Medium | Weekly audit by Ronald, Kyle/Amanda oversight | LOW-MEDIUM |

| 7 | **UK operations gap** | Low | Kinari well-embedded, Amanda coordinating | LOW |
| 8 | **NEW: Ronald scope creep** - positioning as permanent C-suite exec with broad authority beyond finance | Medium | Grant review/guidance on each proposal | MEDIUM |
| 9 | **NEW: SA cash shortfall** - Ronald reports ~R1.17m Feb shortfall | High | 13-week cash forecast (in progress), collections sprint | TO VERIFY |
| 10 | **NEW: Pricing leakage** - mEHT discounts beyond VAT (up to 12.5% on SA 60min) | Medium | Rate card analysis needed | TO VERIFY |
| 11 | **NEW: Accrual gap** - supplier invoices recognised at payment not receipt | Medium | O2P process reform (Ronald proposing) | MEDIUM |

### Mitigation Actions Needed

- **Risk 1:** Consider adding Grant as Level 4 Investec signatory - decision pending
- **Risk 2:** Ensure Alida's drive files are fully transferred before 23 Feb
- **Risk 3:** Begin thinking about permanent structure before Phase 3 recommendation
- **Risk 8:** Set clear boundaries in response to executive diagnosis. Approve finance items, redirect commercial items, correct authority assumptions.
- **Risk 9:** Ask Ronald for supporting detail on the R1.17m shortfall claim before reacting.
- **Risk 10:** Verify pricing leakage numbers against actual rate cards. Understand clinical context for any discounts before changing policy.
