## Active Items Requiring Response

### ACTION-001: Respond to Ronald's Executive Diagnosis Plan
- **Received:** 17 Feb 2026
- **Source:** `new-information/2026-02-17-Ronald-Executive-Diagnosis.md`
- **Priority:** HIGH - Ronald is waiting for direction
- **Status:** GRANT REVIEWING - NOT RESPONDING TODAY
- **Respond by:** This week (before Friday check-in)

**Context:** This was sent directly to Grant only (not to James or Ricardo). Ronald followed proper channel here.

**Grant's initial thoughts (17 Feb):**
- Likes the initiative - Ronald is clearly digging in and showing capability
- Needs to review the detail more closely before responding
- **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: No spend freeze on urgent/critical patient care.** Sanctura is a medical clinic. Time can save lives. Any process controls or approval thresholds must explicitly exclude urgent clinical expenditure at James's discretion. This is non-negotiable and must be made clear to Ronald in the response.
- Not replying today - will review in detail and respond later this week

**Key concerns to address in response:**

1. **Patient care override (Grant's direction)** - Any spend freeze, approval threshold, or payment workflow Ronald proposes MUST have an explicit carve-out for urgent clinical/patient care expenditure. James has full discretion on clinical spend. Ronald comes from corporate/telecom/airline backgrounds - he may not instinctively understand that in a medical practice, a delayed purchase can have patient safety consequences. This needs to be stated clearly and early in the response.

2. **Title & positioning overreach** - Ronald refers to himself as "CFO" throughout and has drafted emails establishing his "mandate" to the full leadership team (James, Ricardo, Grant, Kinari, Yaseen, Amanda). He is a *Fractional CFO / independent consultant* on a 4-month contract. He should not be unilaterally announcing decision rights or sending mandate emails to the CEO and investors. Grant should set the framing of Ronald's role in any communications.

3. **Scope creep beyond contract** - Several items go beyond his contracted scope:
   - **Pricing & discount policy** (Phase 1, item 2) - clinical pricing is a commercial/clinical decision, not a finance function decision. Ronald can *analyse and recommend*, but setting price floors and issuing rate cards to clinicians is not his call.
   - **Packages & prepayment offers** (Phase 1, item 3) - designing mEHT 10-packs and HBOT bundles is product/commercial work. Ronald can model the cash impact, but product design needs James/Grant.
   - **Marketing & demand engine** (Phase 4, item 2) - completely outside finance scope.
   - **Front desk incentives** (Phase 4, item 3) - HR/operational, not finance.
   - **Capacity & utilisation analysis** (Phase 2, item 5) - operational/clinical territory.

4. **Authority assumptions** - Ronald proposes:
   - "Freeze unbudgeted discretionary spend >R10k/£500 without CFO approval" - he doesn't have this authority. If a freeze is warranted, Grant/James should announce it. **And it MUST exclude clinical/patient care spend.**
   - "Centralised Payment Approval Workflow" with thresholds routing to "FM → Ops → CFO → Investor" - this redesigns existing decision rights without approval.
   - "Cash Committee" on Mondays - reasonable concept, but Ronald can't convene meetings with Grant's direct reports and the CEO without Grant's sign-off on the structure.

5. **Unverified claims that need checking:**
   - **R1.17m February shortfall (SA)** - is this accurate? What's the basis?
   - **mEHT pricing leakage numbers** (SA 60min ~12.5% below ex-VAT, etc.) - need to verify these against actual rate cards and understand clinical context for any discounts.
   - **"Cash sales = R0"** - is this literally true or is he misreading the payment structure?
   - **Credits at 6.7%** - what's the benchmark and what's driving credits?

6. **Timing issues:**
   - Phase 0-1 references "Alida (SA execution)" - Alida leaves in 6 days. Unrealistic to assign her execution tasks.
   - "13-week cash forecast this week" - ambitious given he's still in handover.
   - "Rate card & discount policy goes live next week" - far too fast for something that affects clinical pricing.

7. **What IS good and should be approved/encouraged:**
   - The diagnostic itself is sharp and shows he's dug into the numbers quickly
   - 13-week cash forecast methodology (already approved in principle)
   - Weekly KPI pack concept (aligns with contract deliverables)
   - Payment run cadence (Wed submission → Fri payment) - reasonable structure
   - Management pack by T+10 - aligns with contract (7th working day)
   - Vendor master cleanup and PO-lite process
   - Chart of accounts cleanup
   - Collections focus and AR discipline

**Suggested response approach (when Grant is ready):**
- Acknowledge the strong diagnostic work - he's clearly capable and has identified real issues
- **Lead with the patient care constraint** - make it clear that clinical spend is never subject to approval delays
- Redirect on scope: separate what's finance (approved) from what's commercial/clinical (needs Grant/James)
- Correct on authority: he recommends, Grant/James decide and communicate
- Approve the financial workstream items (cash forecast, KPI pack, management pack, payment cadence, vendor master, COA cleanup)
- Defer or redirect pricing, packages, marketing, capacity analysis
- Ask him to verify the R1.17m shortfall claim with supporting detail
- Be clear that any stakeholder communications go through Grant first

### ACTION-002: Approve/Guide Ronald's Supplier Outreach Proposal
- **Received:** 17 Feb 2026
- **Source:** `new-information/2026-02-17-Ronald-Supplier-Proposal.md` and `...-Template.md`
- **Priority:** HIGH - time-sensitive (Feb year-end approaching)
- **Status:** GRANT REVIEWED - READY TO RESPOND

**Summary:** Ronald has correctly followed protocol by requesting Grant's approval before contacting suppliers. He wants to introduce himself, request supplier statements ahead of Feb 2026 year-end, and begin vendor masterfile cleanup in Xero.

**Assessment:** This is a well-structured, appropriate request. Ronald is operating within his boundaries here. Grant likes the initiative.

### Grant's Decisions (17 Feb)

**APPROVED** with the following conditions:

1. **Scope is information-gathering only.** Ronald is approved to introduce himself and request statements and information. He is **NOT to negotiate terms** with any supplier. This is an information and reconciliation exercise, not a commercial negotiation. Any term renegotiation comes later and requires Grant's explicit approval.

2. **Title must be "Interim CFO" (or similar).** Ronald is not a permanent CFO. He must represent himself accurately to suppliers. Grant's preferred title: **"Interim CFO"**. The email signature should reflect this. Grant to provide branded email signature template with correct title.

3. **UK suppliers are a separate workstream and should go through Amanda.** The UK supplier base is different from SA. Ronald should coordinate UK supplier outreach through Amanda (Practice Manager, UK) rather than contacting UK suppliers directly. Amanda has the relationships and context.

4. **SA suppliers** - Ronald can proceed with direct outreach to SA clinical/pharmaceutical suppliers once the email template is corrected (title change).

5. **Vendor masterfile cleanup** - APPROVED. Good housekeeping.

6. **O2P cycle and authority matrix** - APPROVED to draft for Grant's review. Not to implement without sign-off.

**Items still to confirm before Ronald sends:**
- [ ] Correct title in email template ("Chief Financial Officer" → "Interim CFO")
- [ ] Grant to provide branded email signature
- [ ] Confirm `accounts@sancturalife.com` is correct receiving address
- [ ] Clarify SA supplier scope: all at once or priority subset?

**Email template corrections needed:**
- Line: "Chief Financial Officer" → "Interim CFO"
- Add: explicit note that this is an information/statement request only (no commercial discussion)
- Consider: should the email come from Ronald's email or from a shared finance/accounts address?
