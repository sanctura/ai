## Gaps to Fill

The following dates are still needed to make this calendar actionable:

- [ ] Annual return anniversary dates for each SA entity
- [ ] UBO submission due dates
- [ ] BHF and HPCSA renewal dates
- [ ] Insurance policy anniversary dates (SA and UK)
- [ ] Financial year end dates for all entities

**Action:** Ronald should confirm these dates as part of Phase 1 handover from Alida/Inaura/Imperium.
