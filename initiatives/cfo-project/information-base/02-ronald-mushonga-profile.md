## Ronald's Proposed Approach (From Interview)

1. Do hands-on work first to learn "the entire story"
2. Meet auditors immediately - they highlight problem areas fast
3. Identify gaps, develop job descriptions
4. Design 13-week cash flow forecast
5. Hire bookkeeper/processor by Month 2-3 (subject to MD approval)

**Proposed team structure:**
```
Financial Manager (Ronald)
    +-- Junior 1: Payables + Collections
    +-- Leverage: Nurses for invoicing (decentralised model)
```

> "I'm willing to get my hands dirty... doing the operational work in the first month allows me to learn the entire story."
