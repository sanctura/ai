## Purpose

This document tracks Ronald's proposals, plans, and suggestions as they come in. Each item is logged with Grant's review status and guidance notes.

---

## Proposals from Interview / Early Engagement

### 1. 13-Week Rolling Cash Flow Forecast

**What Ronald proposed:** Implement a 13-week rolling cash flow forecast, updated weekly and presented to management.

**Grant's view:** APPROVED in principle - this is a Phase 2 deliverable (Mar-Apr).

**Status:** Ronald has now accelerated this to Phase 1 (Day 1-7) in his executive diagnosis. He wants to deliver it "this week."

**Update 17 Feb:** Ronald's executive plan proposes a detailed model with inflow splits (self-pay vs insurance), settlement lags, scenarios (base/accelerated/prepaid/supplier terming). The methodology is sound but the timeline is aggressive given he's still in handover.

---

### 2. Hire Junior Bookkeeper/Processor (Month 2-3)

**What Ronald proposed:** Hire a junior resource for payables and collections by Month 2-3.

**Grant's view:** TBD - subject to MD approval. Need to evaluate workload reality first.

**Status:** Not yet formally proposed. Mentioned in interview only.

**Notes for Grant:**
- Consider whether workload justifies additional headcount
- What happens to this role after Ronald's contract ends?
- Cost implications - what salary range?
- Could this be the seed of a permanent finance function?

---

### 3. Meet with Auditors Immediately

**What Ronald proposed:** Engage with auditors early as they "highlight problem areas fast."

**Grant's view:** TBD - Ronald must liaise with Grant before initiating direct contact with any service providers.

**Status:** Not yet actioned.

**Notes for Grant:**
- Which auditors? Inaura handles financial statements currently
- May be premature during Phase 1 (handover)
- Could be valuable as part of Phase 2 provider evaluation

---

### 4. Inaura to Bokelman Transition

**What Ronald proposed:** (Part of contract scope) Evaluate and transition from Inaura to Bokelman or equivalent.

**Grant's view:** APPROVED in scope - Phase 2-3 deliverable.

**Status:** Phase 2 (Mar-Apr) evaluation, Phase 3 (May-Jun) transition.

## New Proposals (17 February 2026)

### 5. Executive Diagnosis & 90-Day Strategic Plan

**Date received:** 17 Feb 2026
**Source:** `new-information/2026-02-17-Ronald-Executive-Diagnosis.md`

**What Ronald proposed:** A comprehensive 90-day plan in 4 phases (Phase 0: Mobilise, Phase 1: Stabilise, Phase 2: FP&A Build, Phase 3: Governance, Phase 4: Optimisation). Includes pre-drafted stakeholder emails, a meeting cadence, and a KPI pack structure.

**Diagnostic findings (to verify):**
- SA facing ~R1.17m February shortfall
- UK ~£3.5k shortfall (plus service charges 3 Mar)
- Credits at 6.7% of SA revenue
- Cash sales = R0 (all AR)
- mEHT pricing leakage: SA 60min ~12.5% below ex-VAT, SA 90min ~8.8%, UK 90min ~6.3%, UK HBOT ~10%
- Large "Other sales" buckets obscuring insight
- Freebies creeping in (H2 at £0)

**Grant's initial reaction (17 Feb):** Likes the initiative. Reviewing in detail. Not responding today - will reply later this week.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT FROM GRANT:** Any spend controls, approval thresholds, or payment workflow changes **MUST explicitly exclude urgent/critical patient care expenditure**. Sanctura is a medical clinic - time can save lives. Process must never put a patient at risk. Clinical spend at James's discretion is always exempt from any freeze or approval delay. This is non-negotiable.

**Grant's view:** PARTIALLY APPROVED - see detailed breakdown below

| Item | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Diagnostic analysis** | APPROVED | Sharp work, shows capability. Verify the numbers. |
| **13-week cash forecast** | APPROVED | Core deliverable. Proceed. |
| **Weekly KPI pack** | APPROVED | Aligns with contract. Good structure proposed. |
| **Monthly management pack (T+10)** | APPROVED | Aligns with contract (7th working day). |
| **Payment cadence (Wed/Fri)** | APPROVED | Sensible structure for payment runs. |
| **Chart of accounts cleanup** | APPROVED | Necessary. "Other sales" cleanup is valuable. |
| **Vendor master & PO-lite** | APPROVED | Good governance. Aligns with supplier proposal. |
| **Budget vs actuals** | APPROVED | Standard finance function work. |
| **Collections sprint / AR discipline** | APPROVED | Core deliverable. |
| **Credit note log with reason codes** | APPROVED | Good control mechanism. |
| **Cash Committee (Monday)** | APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS | Ronald can propose, but Grant convenes. Ronald doesn't chair meetings with James/Ricardo. |
| **Spend freeze >R10k/£500** | APPROVED IN PRINCIPLE WITH CRITICAL CARVE-OUT | Concept is reasonable but: (1) Grant/James announce, not Ronald. (2) **Must explicitly exclude urgent clinical/patient care spend** - James has full discretion on clinical purchases. No approval delay may risk patient safety. |
| **Rate card & discount policy** | REDIRECT | Ronald can *analyse* pricing and flag leakage. Setting price floors and issuing policies to clinicians is Grant/James territory. |
| **Packages & prepayment offers** | REDIRECT | Ronald can *model cash impact*. Product/package design is commercial (Grant + James). |
| **Stakeholder mandate emails** | DECLINED | Ronald cannot send emails establishing his "mandate" to James, Ricardo, and the team. Grant introduces Ronald's role and any new controls. |
| **Front desk pricing/collections SOP email** | REDIRECT | Content is useful but should come from Grant/Kyle, not directly from Ronald to clinical staff. |
| **Finance RACI** | APPROVED | Useful deliverable. Draft for Grant's review. |
| **Capacity & utilisation analysis** | DEFERRED | Operational/clinical territory. Not a Phase 1 priority for finance. |
| **Marketing & demand engine** | DECLINED - OUT OF SCOPE | Not finance function work. |
| **Front desk incentives** | DECLINED - OUT OF SCOPE | HR/operational, not finance. |
| **Unit economics deep dive** | DEFERRED | Phase 4 concept is interesting but premature. Revisit after stabilisation. |
| **Quarterly 12-18 month forecast model** | DEFERRED | Ambitious. Focus on 13-week first. Revisit in Phase 3. |

**Key concern:** Ronald is positioning himself as a permanent C-suite executive with broad authority. He's a 4-month fractional consultant. His diagnostic skills are strong, but he needs to operate within his lane: analyse, recommend, and execute approved finance workstreams. Commercial decisions, stakeholder communications, and authority changes flow through Grant.

### 6. Supplier Outreach & AP Reform

**Date received:** 17 Feb 2026
**Source:** `new-information/2026-02-17-Ronald-Supplier-Proposal.md` + `...-Template.md`

**What Ronald proposed:**
1. Contact all clinical/pharmaceutical suppliers to introduce himself and request Feb 2026 year-end statements
2. Clean up Xero vendor masterfile with naming conventions (PHA_SUP_001, ADM_SUP_001)
3. Design an Order-to-Pay (O2P) cycle with authority matrix
4. Requested a formal CFO email signature

**AP Diagnosis findings:**
- Supplier info is fragmented and not standardised
- Vendors not categorised (clinical vs admin)
- Invoices recognised at payment, not receipt (accrual gap)
- No end-to-end O2P process
- Candice holds corporate memory on clinical/pharma suppliers
- Abongile is new, needs onboarding into AP process
- Kyle managing non-pharma suppliers informally

**Grant's view:** APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS - ready to respond

**Grant's decisions (17 Feb):**

| Item | Decision | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Supplier outreach (SA) | APPROVED | Good protocol - he asked first. SA suppliers: Ronald can proceed directly once email is corrected. |
| Supplier outreach (UK) | APPROVED VIA AMANDA | UK suppliers are a different set. Ronald should coordinate UK outreach through Amanda, not contact them directly. |
| Statement requests (Feb year-end) | APPROVED | Timely and necessary. |
| Vendor masterfile cleanup | APPROVED | Good housekeeping. Coding convention is sensible. |
| O2P cycle draft | APPROVED to draft | Submit framework to Grant for review before implementing. |
| Authority matrix draft | APPROVED to draft | Must align with existing decision rights (see doc 06). |

**Corrections required before Ronald proceeds:**
1. **Title:** "Chief Financial Officer" → **"Interim CFO"** (Grant's preferred title). He is not a permanent CFO and must represent himself accurately to external parties.
2. **Scope of engagement with suppliers:** Information and statements ONLY. **Ronald is NOT to negotiate terms** with any supplier. This is a reconciliation and information-gathering exercise. Any commercial negotiation requires separate approval.
3. **UK suppliers route through Amanda.** Ronald coordinates with Amanda; Amanda manages the UK supplier relationships.
4. **Email signature:** Grant to provide a branded template with correct title ("Interim CFO").
5. **Email address:** Confirm `accounts@sancturalife.com` is correct for receiving statements.

**Assessment:** This is exactly how Ronald should be operating - identifying an issue, proposing a solution, and asking for approval before acting. The contrast with the executive diagnosis (where he drafted mandate emails to the full leadership team) is notable. Encourage this approach.

### 7. Handover Priority List (Alida)

**Date received:** 17 Feb 2026
**Source:** `new-information/2026-02-17-Ronald-Handover-List-Plan.md`

**What Ronald proposed:** An 8-item priority list to work through with Alida in the remaining handover days (17-23 Feb).

**Items:**
1. UK Clinic Review - operations, outstanding items, pending reviews
2. Pay-run - complete UK pay-run, review SA pay-run
3. AR - Medical Insurance Claims - follow up outstanding claims, update ageing
4. Saint Raphael Financials - IS, BS, and financial visuals
5. Intercompany Charges - reconcile between Saint Raphael, Inc, and UK Hold-Co
6. Payroll (General) - compliance, schedules, reconciliations
7. Compliance - SARS obligations, regulatory submissions
8. Compressor Feasibility Project - pick up from Yaseen/Alida

**Grant's view:** NOTED - reasonable list. See observations below.

**Observations for Grant to consider:**
- **Good coverage** of the financial essentials (payroll, compliance, AR, intercompany)
- **Compressor project** is interesting - Ronald is picking up operational projects too. This is fine if it doesn't distract from core finance handover.
- **Potential gaps - items NOT on the list that may need to be:**
  - Alida's filing system / drive structure - where everything lives
  - Service provider contact details and relationship context (Inaura, Imperium, Atlantic Trust, Intersure, AON)
  - Insurance policy details and renewal dates
  - Annual return and UBO due dates (the calendar gaps identified in doc 07)
  - Financial year end dates for all entities
  - MedPrax account and login details
  - Office supplier list (cleaning, flowers, laundry, stationery)
  - Banking process nuances (Investec loading specifics, Barclays process)
  - Historical payment patterns and supplier payment terms
  - Any informal arrangements or standing orders Alida managed
- **Time pressure:** Only 6 days remain. Is 8 items realistic? Some of these (intercompany reconciliation, Saint Raphael financials) are substantial pieces of work, not quick handover conversations.
- **Question:** Is this a handover *discussion* list or a handover *completion* list? Ronald should be learning how Alida does these things, not necessarily completing them all before she leaves.
