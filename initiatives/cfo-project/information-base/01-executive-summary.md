# Executive Summary - CFO Transition Project

**Last Updated:** 17 February 2026

---

## What's Happening

Sanctura's long-standing Financial Manager (Alida Wiese) resigned on 26 January 2026 with a last day of 23 February 2026. She was the single point of knowledge across all 7 entities. A fractional CFO, **Ronald Mushonga**, was engaged through Clearshell Management Solutions starting 9 February 2026 on a 4-month contract (ending 9 June 2026) at R115,000/month.

## Where We Are Now (17 February 2026)

- **Alida departs in 6 days** (23 Feb) - final knowledge transfer window is closing
- **Ronald is in Week 2** - overlapping with Alida, absorbing operational knowledge
- **Ronald has submitted his first deliverables** - executive diagnosis plan and supplier outreach proposal (both pending Grant's review/response)
- **Invoicing transformation is live** - decentralised model (nurses/reception create invoices) went live 7 February
- **Payment controls are operational** - Ronald prepares, Grant loads, Exco releases
- **Xero bookkeeping is current** across all three active organisations

### Ronald's Initial Findings (17 Feb - to be verified)
- SA facing ~R1.17m February cash shortfall
- Credits running at 6.7% of SA revenue
- mEHT pricing leakage identified (SA 60min ~12.5% below ex-VAT)
- No standardised management pack or rolling forecast exists
- Vendor management gaps (missed invoices, deposit confusion, disputed charges)
- Supplier data fragmented and uncategorised in Xero

## Critical Dates Ahead

| Date | Event | Risk Level |
|------|-------|------------|
| **23 Feb 2026** | Alida's last day | HIGH - knowledge loss |
| **~24 Feb 2026** | Ronald's first solo payment run | MEDIUM |
| **~7 Mar 2026** | First solo management accounts due | MEDIUM |
| **~10 Mar 2026** | Month 1 review with Ronald | Key checkpoint |
| **End Mar 2026** | VAT period Jan-Feb submission due | Compliance deadline |
| **1 Apr 2026** | New office lease commences | Operational |
| **~10 Apr 2026** | Mid-contract review | Extension discussion |
| **9 Jun 2026** | Ronald's contract ends | HIGH - need permanent solution |

## Top Risks

1. **SARS payment bottleneck** - Only James has Level 4 Investec access for SARS payments. No backup exists.
2. **Knowledge loss after Alida** - 13-day overlap is tight. Undocumented processes may surface gaps.
3. **Contract cliff** - Ronald ends 9 June with no permanent replacement plan yet.
4. **Inaura quality** - Current SA accounting provider has historical issues; transition planned but not started.

## Key Decisions Pending

- Whether to add Grant as Level 4 Investec signatory (SARS backup)
- Permanent finance hire vs extended engagement (Ronald's Phase 3 recommendation)
- Inaura replacement selection (Bokelman or equivalent)
- Invoicing Phase 2 (optimise) timing
- **NEW:** Ronald's external-facing title (he's using "Chief Financial Officer" - needs correction)
- **NEW:** Whether to implement discretionary spend freeze (Ronald proposed >R10k/£500 threshold)
- **NEW:** Pricing/discount policy ownership (Ronald wants to set price floors - commercial decision for Grant/James)

## Grant's Active Response Queue

| Item | Priority | Status | See |
|------|----------|--------|-----|
| Respond to Ronald's executive diagnosis plan | HIGH | Pending | `09-action-items.md` ACTION-001 |
| Approve/correct Ronald's supplier outreach | HIGH | Pending | `09-action-items.md` ACTION-002 |
