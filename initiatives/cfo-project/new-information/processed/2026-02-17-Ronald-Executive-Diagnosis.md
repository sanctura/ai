**🧭 Executive Diagnosis (Concise)**

* **Cash is reactive and tight**: SA facing **\~R1.17m Feb shortfall**; UK **\~£3.5k** (plus service charges 3 Mar). Forecasts appear only when asked, not rolling.  
* **Working capital unmanaged**: High **credits** (SA 6.7%), **cash sales \= R0** (all AR), large payments with poor scheduling; debtors/creditors only surfaced on request.  
* **Fragmented processes**: Multiple entities (UK Ltd, JL Inc, Saint Raphael, Trust); approvals split across individuals; no unified **cash office** or standard cut-offs.  
* **Vendor management weak**: Missed Sloane invoice, Randox deposit confusion, disputed Loop Local charges; CCS invoice details wrong; inconsistent approvals.  
* **No standardised management pack**: Missing operational KPIs, debtor/creditor pack, cash bridge, and forecast roll-forward.  
* **Commercial leakage**: **mEHT discounting** beyond VAT (SA 60 min \~12.5% below ex-VAT; SA 90 min \~8.8%; UK 90 min \~6.3%; UK HBOT \~10%). **Large “Other sales” buckets** dilute insight. **Freebies** creeping in (H2 at £0).

**Bottom line:** This is a **stabilisation \+ controls \+ FP\\\&A build-out** mandate. Quick wins are available in **cash discipline, pricing guardrails, and vendor control**.

**1\) Mandate & cadence (to Grant, Ricardo, James, Alida, Kinari, Yaseen, Amanda)**  
Subject: Finance Stabilisation Plan & Weekly Cadence  
Team,  
As part of the finance stabilisation, we’re implementing a few immediate controls to ensure **no cash surprises**, **clean reporting**, and **faster decisions**:  
**Cadence**  
• Cash Committee: Mondays 08:30 SA/UK (15 mins)  
• Payment Process: **Invoices due Wed 12:00** → Payment run **Fri**  
• Weekly KPI pack: Mondays EOD  
• Monthly management pack: **T+10**  
**Controls**  
• No payment without **Invoice \+ PO/Contract \+ Budget line \+ Approval**  
• Temporary freeze on **unbudgeted discretionary spend** (\>R10k / £500) without CFO approval  
• **Price floor & discount policy** goes live next week (front desk brief to follow)  
I’ll circulate the **13-week cash view** and **approval matrix** this week.  
Thanks for the quick collaboration as we lock this down.  
Ronald  
**2\) Front desk & clinicians (pricing/collections)**  
Subject: Pricing Guardrails & Collections SOP (Effective Immediately)  
Team,  
To protect cashflow and ensure fairness, we’re implementing:  
• **Price floors** per modality; any discount **must be pre-approved** by GM/CFO  
• **Prepayment** required for therapy packages; deposits for high-value treatments  
• **Same-day payment** for non-insured patients (card/EFT available)  
We’ll share the **Rate Card & Discount Policy** and **offer sheets** tomorrow. Please escalate any exceptions immediately.  
Thank you,
