Hi Grant 

Following on the below, here is a draft email to introduce myself to the vendors:

Supplier Email Draft (for your review)
Subject: Introduction & Request for Supplier Statement – February 2026
Dear [Supplier Name/Team],
I hope you are well.
My name is Ronald Mushonga, and I have recently joined the organisation as the Chief Financial Officer.
As part of strengthening our financial controls and supplier relationships, I am reviewing our accounts payable processes, vendor records, and reconciliations.
As we approach our financial year‑end (29 February 2026), I would appreciate it if you could kindly provide your latest supplier statement, reflecting all invoices, credits, and payments to date.
Please forward the statement to:
accounts@sancturalife.com 
If there are any updates to your contact details, banking information, delivery instructions, or order procedures, please include them so we can ensure your vendor profile is accurate going forward.
Thank you for your assistance and for your continued support.
Warm regards,
Ronald Mushonga
Chief Financial Officer
