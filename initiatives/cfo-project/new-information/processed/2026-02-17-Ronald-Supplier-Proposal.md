Hi Grant
I hope you’re well.
I wanted to check in with you before making contact with any of our suppliers. I have completed an initial review of the current state of Accounts Payable and supplier management, and I would appreciate your guidance and approval on the next steps, including outbound communication.
1. High-Level AP/Supplier Diagnosis
From my initial assessment, the following issues have been identified:
A. Supplier Tracking & Data Integrity
Supplier information is fragmented, not standardised, and in some cases incomplete.
Vendors are not categorised (clinical/pharmaceutical vs admin/non‑clinical), making reporting and reconciliations difficult.
B. Lack of Accrual Discipline
Supplier invoices are often only recognised when payment is due, not when goods/services are received.
This results in understated liabilities and inconsistent month-end and year-end financials.
C. Limited O2P (Order‑to‑Pay) Structure
There is no consistent end‑to‑end process covering:
PO → GRN → Invoice Processing → Reconciliation → Payment → Filing
Documentation, approvals, and audit trail are inconsistent or informal.
D. Responsibilities Are Unclear
Candice has most of the corporate memory with clinical/pharmaceutical suppliers.
Abongile is new and needs clear onboarding into the procurement/AP process.
Kyle is managing the non‑pharmaceutical suppliers, but processes are not standardised.
2. Proposed Remedial Plan (Request for Approval)
I would like to implement the following reforms, beginning immediately after year-end:
A. Supplier Communication & Statement Request (Pending Your Go-Ahead)
Before the Feb 2026 year-end close, I would like to contact all clinical/pharmaceutical suppliers to:
Introduce myself as the new CFO
Request up-to-date supplier statements
Begin formal vendor onboarding in Xero
Correct any outstanding balances ahead of audit
I’ve prepared a draft supplier communication for your review before sending anything out.
B. Xero Vendor Masterfile Clean-Up
Create formal naming and coding conventions (e.g., PHA_SUP_001, ADM_SUP_001)
Split creditors between:
Trade Creditors – Clinical & Pharmaceutical
Trade Creditors – Administrative & Operational
C. Implementation of an O2P Cycle & Authority Matrix
I would like us to design an institutionalised Order‑to‑Pay cycle that includes:
Purchase Order (PO) requirements and thresholds
Delegation of authority matrix
GRN (goods received note) controls
Invoice matching
Month-end supplier reconciliations
Payment approval workflow
Digital filing in Xero
I will draft a proposed framework for your input, but I would appreciate your direction on any prior attempts or preferred structures.
3. Request: CFO Email Signature
Once the supplier communication is approved, could you please assist in designing a formal CFO email signature for consistency with the corporate brand? I would like to ensure all external communication reflects a consolidated and professional identity.
4. Next Steps (Subject to Your Sign-Off)
Once I have your approval, I will:
Finalise supplier communication
Begin requesting Feb 2026 statements
Start the vendor coding clean‑up in Xero
Draft the new O2P + authority matrix workflow for your review
Let me know if you'd like to meet to run through the AP findings, or if you'd prefer I proceed via email.
Thanks,
Ronald Mushonga
