Hi Ronald,

Thanks for this - good initiative and I appreciate you running it past me before reaching out.

I'm happy to approve the supplier outreach with a few conditions:

**Scope**
- This should be an introduction and information-gathering exercise only. Please request statements, confirm contact details, and update vendor records - but do not enter into any discussion around terms, pricing, or payment arrangements at this stage. Any commercial negotiation will be a separate conversation that we'll align on first.

**Title**
- You're currently engaged as our Interim CFO, so please update the email signature and any communications to reflect that accurately. I'll get a branded email signature set up for you - I'll send that through separately.

**UK Suppliers**
- The UK supplier base is a different set and Amanda has the existing relationships there. Please coordinate any UK supplier outreach through Amanda rather than contacting them directly. She can either send the communications herself or introduce you as appropriate.

**SA Suppliers**
- You're clear to proceed with SA suppliers directly once the email template is updated with the correct title.

On the broader AP reforms - the vendor masterfile cleanup in Xero and the coding conventions you've proposed make sense, go ahead with that. On the O2P cycle and authority matrix, please draft the framework and send it through for my review before we implement anything.

Regarding the email signature, I'll sort that out for you. Give me a day or two.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Grant
