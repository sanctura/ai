## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository for managing the hiring and onboarding of Mohammed (Mo) Desai as a part-time consultant for Sanctura Limited (UK healthcare company). It contains no code - only markdown documents for HR planning, contract drafting, and engagement management.

## Repository Structure

```
/background/          - Source materials (CV, discussion notes, reference contracts)
/information-base/    - Structured planning documents (indexed by 00-index.md)
/contract/            - Draft contracts and HR review notes
```

## Working with This Repository

- The `information-base/00-index.md` file serves as the master index and status tracker
- Contract documents should be versioned (e.g., `consultancy-agreement-draft-v1.md`)
- When updating commercial terms, ensure consistency across all documents (engagement structure, contract, HR notes)
- Placeholders in contracts use the format `[Item to be confirmed]`
