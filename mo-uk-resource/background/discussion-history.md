## Comprehensive Summary: Engagement Discussions with Mohammed (Mo)

### Context & Background

Mohammed is a highly experienced senior pharmacy and healthcare operations professional with over 30 years’ experience, including:

* Senior leadership roles in private healthcare (notably HCA / Harley Street Clinic)
* Extensive experience in pharmacy operations, aseptic services, cleanrooms, GMP, licensing, and regulatory compliance
* Strong background in oncology pharmacy, clinical trials, and complex medication preparation
* Experience designing and commissioning aseptic units and leading pharmacy relocations
* Exposure to operational improvement, governance, supplier management, and financial responsibility
* Ongoing consultancy and contractor-style work across NHS and private healthcare
* Some involvement with technology-enabled solutions and systems improvement, with interest in AI-related applications

He was initially interviewed some time ago by Sanctura’s CEO for a role that was not ultimately filled. Subsequently, the COO explored a part-time engagement with him but did not progress it to completion. You (Grant) have since taken ownership of the process to move it forward decisively.

### Current Working Situation (Mohammed)

* Mohammed is **currently contracted as a contractor** (not employee) with an NHS trust
* Contracted for **37.5 hours per week until at least end of February**
* NHS contract is typically extended in **3-month increments**
* He has indicated he can **free up time in February and March** to work with Sanctura by using annual leave, with a reassessment thereafter
* He is comfortable with flexible, consulting-style arrangements and short-term trial phases

---

### Engagement Intent (Sanctura Side)

* Strong interest in bringing Mohammed in on a **part-time basis**
* Initial intent is a **trial consulting engagement**, with genuine potential to evolve into a longer-term or permanent role if successful
* Clear desire to benefit from his senior operational and pharmacy expertise rather than a narrow, task-based consultancy

---

### Proposed Structure (Agreed Direction)

* **Engagement type:** Direct engagement with Sanctura (not via umbrella company)
* **Commercial structure:** Month-to-month consulting arrangement
* **Payment cadence:** Monthly payment
* **Rate:** Expected to sit within **£40–£50 per hour**, with direct engagement allowing a lower effective rate than umbrella arrangements
* **Flexibility:** Explicit flexibility built in for both parties given his NHS commitments
* **Notice period:** Intention to keep notice short and simple (e.g. 2–4 weeks)

---

### Time Commitment Plan

* **February:**

  * 2 days per week
* **March onward:**

  * Increase to 3 days per week, subject to mutual agreement and value demonstrated
* Engagement to be **reviewed monthly**

### Focus Areas & Role Scope (Initial View)

Mohammed’s role is expected to span several interconnected domains:

1. **Operational Efficiency & Clinic Operations**

   * Review and improve day-to-day operational efficiency
   * Patient flow and patient management processes
   * Management of existing patients and onboarding of new clients
   * General operational systems and workflows across the practice

2. **Pharmacy & Aseptic / Regulatory Initiatives**

   * Laminar flow and cleanroom feasibility
   * Medication preparation, mixing, and licensing requirements
   * Regulatory and compliance considerations
   * Supplier engagement and management, including:

     * UK-based suppliers
     * European suppliers
     * Reliability, quality, and cost considerations

3. **Leadership & Feasibility Support**

   * Strengthening UK operational leadership structures
   * Supporting feasibility assessments for new initiatives
   * Helping define operating cadence (huddles, issue tracking, escalation)
   * Cross-functional and cross-site alignment where relevant

4. **Technology, AI, and Research (Optional / Additive)**

   * Exploring opportunities where technology or AI could support operations
   * Input into systems, data, or research-related initiatives
   * Leveraging his exposure to AI solutions used by other clients, where appropriate

---

### Strategic Framing

* Engagement is intentionally framed as:

  * **Senior, embedded consulting**
  * Not ad-hoc or transactional
  * Designed to deliver leadership leverage, operational clarity, and regulatory confidence
* Both sides have expressed alignment and enthusiasm
* Mohammed has explicitly stated that:

  * The scope resonates strongly with his background and interests
  * He sees real potential to add value
  * He is motivated by the prospect of building something meaningful rather than short-term work

---

### Current Status

* Both parties aligned on:

  * Direct, month-to-month engagement
  * Feb → March ramp-up
  * Trial-first approach
* Meeting scheduled (Tuesday 12:00) to:

  * Finalise structure
  * Confirm availability
  * Align on initial priorities
* Next step after meeting:

  * Provide HR / Legal with agreed summary to draft a simple agreement

---

### Key Planning Signals (Implicit)

* Mohammed is senior, autonomous, and outcome-focused
* Best leveraged as a **multiplier** (systems, leadership, structure), not an executor
* Clear value likely in first 30–60 days if focus is well-defined
* Engagement should remain flexible but intentional to avoid under-utilisation
