Thanks for this .
Main issue is that this agreement is drafted with me being a contractor , rather than a fixed term employee of the company ( the basis for a reduced rate) 
As such I will still need to go through an umbrella company and will be liable for NI, fees etc ( as this likely falls inside IR35)
We can still go down the route outlined  in the contract, if that suits Sanctura ,  but will need to increase the rate to £49-£50 to account for the above .
Apologies , if this wasn’t more clearly  articulated in our discussion .

The only other comment is the fixed 15 hours per week . We discussed possibility/ need to increase to 3 days per week in March . This of course will be need to discussed and mutually agreed. I suggest adding a clause in to account for that .

If a follow up discussion is required , happy to accommodate tomorrow.

Many thanks ,
Mo
