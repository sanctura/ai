## Differences from Bank Staff Template

This contract differs significantly from the previous bank staff agreement because:

1. **Fixed commitment** - Mo has a guaranteed 15 hours/week, not zero-hours bank arrangement
2. **Consultancy structure** - Structured as independent contractor, not worker
3. **Monthly rolling** - Auto-renews monthly rather than per-shift assignments
4. **Senior scope** - Includes IP assignment and broader confidentiality provisions appropriate for senior consultant access
5. **Services schedule** - Includes defined scope of work in Schedule 1

## Questions for Discussion

1. Is the consultancy structure appropriate, or should this be structured differently (e.g., as a fixed-term employment contract)?

2. Are there any additional clauses typically required for healthcare consultants in the UK?

3. Should there be any restrictive covenants (non-compete, non-solicitation)?

4. Is the Working Time Regulations opt-out needed given the part-time nature?

## Next Steps

1. HR to review and provide feedback
2. Confirm open items listed above
3. Legal review if required
4. Send final draft to Mohammed for review
5. Arrange signing before 10 February start date
