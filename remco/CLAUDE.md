| `02-staff-roster-complete.md` | Full staff list with roles, managers, locations, eligibility status |
| `03-economic-factors.md` | SA and UK economic indicators (CPI, electricity, lending rates) |
| `04-special-cases.md` | Staff requiring individual decisions, confirmed exclusions |
| `05-open-questions.md` | Unresolved questions and project checklist |
| `06-framework-principles.md` | Agreed framework from December 2025 RemCo meeting |

## Key Context
