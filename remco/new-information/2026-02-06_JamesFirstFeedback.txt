Hi Grant, 

I think Lexee should be at least 8% or slightly more.
Amanda at this stage 0, can be performance based.

Maria Tam can be offered 4% if she is full time employee. Do we offer her a nominal 2% for now?. Or 1.5% now and 5.5% if full time / available weekend shifts. 

Yaseen 0%. Performance based. Same as you or I. Well your position has changed. KPI related? Please take advice Siraj. Might have to have an option for increase vs KPI. 

I would also need my relative "KPI" or increase included; before end Feb. 

Will Nuhaa have KPI's and increase, and Kyle choice between increase Vs KPI balance. (KPI I mean incentive based KPI with ratios).

Please check calculations monthly fee increase end of table UK. Stated 12k GBP

Consulting fees / procedures et al need to increase from March on Xero

7% high. How does this match up with Bonus given last year July in Lieu of increase? I imagine increase respects this. Happy with 7%, but then end of year bonus depends on company performance. 

Kind Regards,
