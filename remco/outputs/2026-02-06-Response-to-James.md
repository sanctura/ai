# Proposed Response to James - 6 February 2026

*Draft for Grant's review before sending*

---

Hi James,

Thank you for the detailed feedback. I've worked through each point and here's where we've landed:

**Lexee Duval** — Agreed. Lexee is now at **8%**, double the UK inflation rate. This recognises her standout contribution and is reflected in the updated proposal.

**Amanda Ross** — I'd recommend we keep Amanda at the **standard 4%**. Moving her to 0% without documented performance issues creates a precedent that could be difficult to manage, particularly as it would be the only reduction from the standard rate without a formal basis. If there are performance concerns, we can address those through the appropriate process and revisit at the next review.

**Maria Tam** — Maria stays at **4%** in line with her current compensation. I take the point about incentivising full-time availability, but structuring a conditional arrangement around weekend shifts is beyond what we can coordinate within the February timeline. We could revisit this as a separate conversation once the increases are concluded.

**Yaseen** — Agreed, **0%**. This will be handled carefully and linked to the KPI framework discussion.

**KPIs (Yaseen, Nuhaa, Kyle, and your own)** — As we agreed, the KPI/incentive framework review is scheduled for **March**, once we're past the financial year-end and new targets and budgets are in place. This applies to Nuhaa and Kyle's incentive structures as well. I'd suggest we park this for now and tackle it properly next month when we have the full picture.

**Your own increase** — Given the way your remuneration is structured, I'd recommend we handle this **separately from the staff salary process**. This review needs to conclude by end of February, and your situation warrants its own discussion. We can still aim to resolve it within February, but it shouldn't hold up the broader staff proposal.

**UK calculation (£12k)** — I believe this may have stemmed from a currency labelling error in the spreadsheet, which has now been corrected. The actual UK annual increase total is **£6,856** across three staff members (Amanda, Maria Tam, and Lexee). Please check the updated spreadsheet (V4) and let me know if the figure you're seeing still doesn't reconcile.

**Consulting fees on Xero** — Noted. This is important but falls outside the scope of this staff increase proposal. We'll pick this up separately as part of the March financial year transition.

**7% SA rate and the mid-year bonus** — The 7% reflects the fact that this is the **first salary increase in two years** (last increase was June 2024). While an interim bonus was paid in June 2025, it was a one-off bridging measure, not a salary adjustment. The 7% accounts for cumulative CPI, significant electricity cost increases (9-12%), and the high lending rate environment. The accompanying economic summary document has the full detail if you'd like to review the supporting data. Regarding end-of-year bonuses, agreed — these should be assessed against company performance as a separate exercise.

I've updated the proposal spreadsheet to V4 with these changes and the corrected currency columns. The updated directors summary is also attached.

Happy to discuss any of the above.

Kind regards,
Grant
