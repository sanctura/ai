## Changes From Original Proposal

The following adjustments were made during the meeting:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Lexee Duval** — 8% → **17%** | Increased to align with the new receptionist's salary. New salary rounded up to ~£33k pa (£2,738 pm) |
| **Sweetness Twalo** — 7% → **28%** | Significant increase at CEO's discretion given her low salary and long tenure with the company. New salary R12,954 pm |
| **London nurses (pro-rata)** — 0% → **2%** | Alicia Reihill and Jasmin Pulanco to receive a pro-rata 2% increase despite being under 6 months service |
| **Rasa Elvis Soki** — **Removed** | Elvis is James's personal gardener and not a Sanctura employee. Removed from the review entirely |
