## How We Reached These Recommendations

### Starting Point: Baseline Inflation

Our approach used regional inflation rates as the baseline starting point for determining appropriate increase levels:

| Region | Inflation Baseline | Additional Factors | Proposed Rate |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **South Africa** | CPI 3.2-3.6% | +2 years since last increase, +electricity costs (9-12%), +high lending rates (10.25%) | **7%** |
| **United Kingdom** | CPIH 3.6% | First increases for UK staff, lower cost pressures | **4%** |

### South Africa Rationale (7%)

The SA increase of 7% exceeds baseline CPI (3.2-3.6%) due to:
- **Two-year gap** since the last salary increase (June 2024)
- **Significant electricity cost increases**: Eskom +12.74%, City of Cape Town +9.32% in 2025, with projected +10.5% in 2026
- **High lending rate environment** at 10.25%, impacting staff cost of living
- An interim bonus was paid in June 2025 to partially bridge this gap

### United Kingdom Rationale (4%)

The UK increase of 4% aligns closely with CPIH of 3.6% because:
- **First increases** for UK staff (operations commenced May 2025)
- **Lower cost pressures**: electricity only +2%, Bank of England rate at 3.75%
- Establishing a baseline for future annual reviews

## Framework Principles

As agreed at the December 2025 Remuneration Committee meeting:

1. Salary increases are **not contractually guaranteed** and remain at the sole discretion of the company
2. Increases must align with company performance and financial sustainability
3. Increases are aligned with the **financial year (March)**, not calendar dates
4. Reviews are conducted simultaneously for both regions while allowing for regional economic differences

## Next Steps

1. Review attached spreadsheet for individual staff details
2. Confirm final percentages within proposed ranges
3. Communicate to staff following board approval

Please review the attached spreadsheet containing the full staff list with individual recommendations.
