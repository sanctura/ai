## How We Reached These Recommendations

### Starting Point: Baseline Inflation

Our approach used regional inflation rates as the baseline starting point for determining appropriate increase levels:

| Region | Inflation Baseline | Additional Factors | Proposed Rate |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **South Africa** | CPI 3.2-3.6% | +2 years since last increase, +electricity costs (9-12%), +high lending rates (10.25%) | **7%** |
| **United Kingdom** | CPIH 3.6% | First increases for UK staff, lower cost pressures | **4%** |

### South Africa Rationale (7%)

The SA increase of 7% exceeds baseline CPI (3.2-3.6%) due to:
- **Two-year gap** since the last salary increase (June 2024)
- **Significant electricity cost increases**: Eskom +12.74%, City of Cape Town +9.32% in 2025, with projected +10.5% in 2026
- **High lending rate environment** at 10.25%, impacting staff cost of living
- An interim bonus was paid in June 2025 to partially bridge this gap

### United Kingdom Rationale (4%)

The UK increase of 4% aligns closely with CPIH of 3.6% because:
- **First increases** for UK staff (operations commenced May 2025)
- **Lower cost pressures**: electricity only +2%, Bank of England rate at 3.75%
- Establishing a baseline for future annual reviews

---

## Eligibility Criteria Applied

Staff qualify for an increase if they meet **all** of the following:
- Employed for more than 6 months
- Not currently on probation
- Not newly appointed
- Not under performance or role-related review

### Excluded from This Review

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Staff with <6 months service | Probationary period / insufficient tenure |
| Locums | Casual/temporary engagement excluded |
| Consultants | External contracts excluded |
| Recent contract changes | Already addressed in new terms |
| Recent promotions/increases | Assessed on case-by-case basis |

---

## Financial Impact

| Metric | Cape Town (ZAR) | London (GBP) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Monthly Increase | R13,521 | £571 |
| **Annual Increase** | **R162,256** | **£6,856** |

**Total Annual Cost: £6,856 + R162,256**

---

## Framework Principles

As agreed at the December 2025 Remuneration Committee meeting:

1. Salary increases are **not contractually guaranteed** and remain at the sole discretion of the company
2. Increases must align with company performance and financial sustainability
3. Increases are aligned with the **financial year (March)**, not calendar dates
4. Reviews are conducted simultaneously for both regions while allowing for regional economic differences

---

## Next Steps

1. Review the spreadsheet linked above for full individual details
2. Confirm final percentages
3. Communicate to staff following board approval
4. KPI/incentive framework review to follow in March post financial year-end
