# Option C: The Phong Nha Focus - Vietnam Family Holiday 2026

## Summary

Prioritize the world-class caves of Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park with maximum time for multiple cave experiences. Skip Hue entirely in favor of 5 full nights in Phong Nha, allowing for the full range of adventures—from Paradise Cave to Dark Cave to the unforgettable Duck Stop. The northern segment trades Ninh Binh time for deeper Hanoi exploration. This option is for adventure-seekers who want to fully experience Vietnam's most unique natural wonder.
