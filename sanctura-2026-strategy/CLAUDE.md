This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository containing Sanctura Group's strategic planning documents for 2026-2028. Sanctura operates integrative oncology and metabolic medicine clinics in Cape Town and London.

## Structure

- **background/** — Source documents from strategy sessions and workshops (CEO discussions, CFO workshop, Exco sessions)
- **strategy/** — Board-ready strategy documents synthesized from background materials:
  - `01-executive-summary.md` — Quick-read overview for Directors
  - `02-h1-2026-operating-plan.md` — Detailed H1 2026 priorities (Speed 1: Stabilise)
  - `03-strategic-roadmap-2026-2028.md` — Long-term vision (Speed 2: Build & Expand)
  - `04-clinic-profiles.md` — Site-specific context for Cape Town and London

## Key Concepts

- **Two-Speed Strategy**: Speed 1 (Jan-Jul 2026) focuses on stabilisation; Speed 2 (Aug 2026-Dec 2028) focuses on strategic expansion
- **Constraint shift**: Business moving from capacity-constrained to conversion-constrained as clinic capacity expands ~5×
- **Cape Town**: Foundation clinic, oncology hub development with Dr. Kathan, 10 Dorp Street expansion
- **London**: VIP-focused clinic requiring MO structure redesign and operational leadership

## Document Standards

- Documents are written for Directors/Board consumption
- Scannable format with tables and clear section headers
- Cross-references between documents where appropriate
- Confidential internal documents
