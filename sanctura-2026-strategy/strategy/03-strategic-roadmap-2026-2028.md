## Strategic Initiatives

### 1. Cape Town Oncology Hub Development

Cape Town is the foundation for the long-term oncology vision. The objective is to build a flagship integrated oncology hub.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Dr. Louis Kathan engagement | Oncologist partnership to expand clinical capabilities |
| 10 Dorp Street | Commercial and clinical build-out for expanded capacity |
| Chemotherapy licensing | Regulatory pathway and facility requirements |
| Radiation therapy (RT) bunker | Long-term capability expansion (licensing, facility, investment gates) |
| Regenerative medicine integration | Complement oncology with broader metabolic and regenerative services |

**Milestone planning required:** Define what must be achieved vs longer-horizon items; licensing timelines are long-lead.

---

### 2. London VIP Clinic Stabilisation and Growth

London has demonstrated strong demand, particularly among VIP and international patients. The objective is to convert operational stabilisation (Speed 1) into sustained growth.

| Focus Area | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Full-time MO structure | Essential for clinical continuity and CEO capacity release |
| Operational leadership | Enable consistent patient experience and issue resolution |
| Conversion optimisation | Leverage improved systems from Speed 1 |
| VIP experience refinement | High-touch, consistent service for international patients |

---

### 3. Technology Platforms

Technology maturity varies across sites. A unified backbone is central to the next wave of organisational scale.

| Platform | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Semble | Practice management system evaluation | Decision required |
| Patient Portal | Digital patient engagement, booking, information access | Design and scoping |
| Automation suite | Workflow automation across clinical and administrative processes | Pilot identification |
| Integrated financial systems | Xero consolidation, forecasting, reporting | Foundation laid in Speed 1 |

**Principle:** Platform changes must not disrupt clinical operations. Staged rollout with clear go/no-go gates.

---

### 4. Commercial Engines

Diversified revenue streams extend the Sanctura experience beyond clinic walls.

| Engine | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| E-commerce platform | Supplements and services (own-range and curated) |
| ShyftOne marketing | Content-driven marketing, SEO, demand generation |
| Hydrovitality | Product innovation and productisation |
| Randox and external products | Partnership-driven offerings |

**Own-range supplements:** Product scope, compliance requirements, margin model, and go/no-go gates required.

---

### 5. International Expansion

Prepare the organisation structurally and operationally for expansion beyond current markets.

| Market | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Dublin | Feasibility assessment |
| Netherlands | Feasibility assessment |
| Portugal | Feasibility assessment |
| KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) | Feasibility assessment |
| UAE | Feasibility assessment |

**Feasibility process:** Each market requires defined owner, decision date, required data, and capital requirements.

**Target:** At least one new international clinic operational or in late-stage development by end of 2028.

---

## Governance and Reporting

### Portfolio Management

All initiatives are evaluated using a structured, weighted scoring framework across:
- Strategic Alignment
- Financial Impact
- Effort/Complexity
- Capacity Fit
- Risk
- Time Sensitivity

| Tier | Score Range | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 Must-Do | 75–100 | Immediate priority |
| Tier 2 Strategic | 55–74 | Sequenced execution |
| Tier 3 Opportunistic | <55 | Deferred or conditional |

### Review Cadence

| Review | Participants | Frequency |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Monthly Execution Review | CEO + CTO/CCO + Clinic Leads | Monthly |
| Quarterly Strategic Review | CTO/CCO + CFO + Directors | Quarterly |
| Annual Strategy Refresh | Leadership team | Annually |

### Portfolio Owner

CTO/CCO (Grant Merwitz) maintains the master portfolio with accountability for:
- Project sequencing and gating
- Capacity allocation
- Cross-initiative coordination
- Board reporting
