# H1 2026 Operating Plan (Speed 1)

**Focus:** Stabilise & Strengthen
**Timeframe:** January–July 2026
**Prepared for:** Directors/Board
**Status:** Confidential Internal Document

## Six-Month Goal

**Meet revenue targets with margin discipline.**

Revenue alone is insufficient. We must track and hold ourselves accountable to margin performance alongside top-line growth.

---

## Strategic Context: The Constraint Shift

The business is approaching a step-change in capacity. By late February 2026, we expect approximately **5× clinic capacity** versus late 2025 in both UK and SA, driven by:

- Nursing staff onboarding
- Reception and operational staffing
- Increased clinical capacity (mEHT, HBOT)

**Implication:** The constraint has moved from *capacity* to *conversion and operations*.

A prior pattern showed increased marketing driving busyness up ~100% while revenue improved only 5–10%. This signals leakage in conversion and operational throughput.

**Guiding Principle:** Increase marketing only in lockstep with proven conversion capacity.

## Priority Areas

### 1. Finance

**Goal:** Billing is consistent, timely, policy-driven, and friction-minimised.

| Initiative | Deliverables |
|------------|--------------|
| Billing system + weekly discipline | Billing SOP (payment timing, deposits, refunds, discounts); weekly reconciliation workflow; AR ageing and collections reporting |
| Quote → invoice linkage | Standard quote templates mapped to protocols; versioning rules; plain-English rationale for patients |
| Margin & cost tracking | Weekly revenue, direct costs, contribution margin; decision thresholds for spend adjustment |
| Pharmacy profit/efficiency | SKU rationalisation; stock control; clear bundling rules |
| CFO onboarding | Financial architecture build; forecasting capability; clinic-level margin visibility |

**End-of-February milestone:** Billing operationally in place—billing system, patients paying, sorted out.

---

### 2. Revenue Engine

**Goal:** Maximise conversion from the expanded capacity.

#### 2.1 Conversion (Primary Lever)

| Component | Deliverables |
|-----------|--------------|
| Closer function | Closer playbook (scripts, branching logic, FAQ library, escalation rules); 10-minute follow-up protocol; weekly QA review of sample calls |
| Protocol clarity | Standard "take-home protocol summary" format (weekly schedule + rationale + expected experience); internal training so staff can explain consistently |
| Conversion metrics | Track: enquiry → consult → quoted → started; time-to-start; drop-off reasons (cost, confusion, timing, trust, medical uncertainty) |

#### 2.2 Marketing (Controlled Dial)

Marketing is a controllable dial that must be tuned carefully to avoid runaway costs without proportional revenue.

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Content catalogue | Inventory what exists, what's missing, where published |
| Provider outreach pack | Concise, credible materials for referring clinicians/partners |
| Month 3 dial-up plan | Explicit timing for marketing increase once conversion is stable |

#### 2.3 Capacity Utilisation (mEHT / HBOT)

With capacity expanding, the risk becomes under-utilisation if conversion doesn't keep pace.

- Machine utilisation targets
- Scheduling throughput optimisation
- Staffing competency on machines

---

### 3. UK Medical Officer

**Goal:** Clear accountability for clinical standards without compromising revenue alignment.

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Role clarity | Define what MO owns vs what sits with CEO/ops/clinical leads |
| Clinical governance cadence | Weekly/biweekly review of incidents, patient feedback, protocol deviations |
| Training sign-off | Ensure staff competency to deliver protocols consistently |

---

### 4. Compliance

**Goal:** CQC readiness, visible credentials, and formal governance.

| Initiative | Deliverables |
|------------|--------------|
| Compliance dashboard | CQC readiness items, insurance renewals, SOP status, incident log |
| Certificate tracking | Training completed, certificates received, what must be displayed (e.g., wall by the lift in UK) |
| Governance committee | Operating rhythm, agenda template, decisions log, assigned actions |

Training and compliance are distinct but linked: patients notice inconsistency, creating reputational and conversion risk.

---

### 5. UK Leadership

**Goal:** Operational execution and issue triage.

| Deliverable | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| UK leadership operating system | Daily/weekly huddles; issue triage and action board; cross-site alignment (UK/SA) |
| Feasibility pipeline | List of feasibility topics, owner, decision date, required data |
| Supplier management | Supplier list, SLA expectations, pricing, reliability metrics |

---

## System Efficiency: Six-Month Must-Do vs Deferred

The "System Efficiency" workstream must be split into items that directly impact six-month revenue versus longer-horizon improvements.

### Must-Do (Direct Revenue Impact)

1. **Closer function & decision flow** — immediate conversion lever
2. **Take-home protocol summary + protocol clarity** — reduces confusion, improves conversion
3. **Payment terms + billing execution discipline** — prevents revenue leakage
4. **Medical instructions / formal process** — reduces variation and conflicting guidance
5. **Review/testimonials/feedback loop** — captures proof points, fixes experience issues quickly

### Deferred (6+ Months Unless Easy Wins)

- Research questionnaire
- Welcome pack (potentially expensive; best after protocol commitment)
- Broader packages expansion
- System re-platforming (unless major bottleneck)

---

## Critical Path

The following sequence represents the critical path to revenue improvement:

```
1. Billing system + payment terms (end of Feb)
       ↓
2. Closer function + decision flow + 10-minute follow-ups
       ↓
3. Protocol clarity + take-home summaries
       ↓
4. Training & certificate visibility + consistency
       ↓
5. Marketing dial-up (Month 3+, once conversion is stable)
```

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Top-of-funnel growth without conversion capacity | Busyness up 100%, revenue up 5–10% | Marketing dial controlled; conversion-first sequencing |
| Inconsistent staff guidance | Patient trust erosion; conversion leakage | Training cadence; protocol documentation; clinical governance |
| Billing and policy gaps | Revenue leakage; administrative drag | Billing SOP by end of February; weekly reconciliation |
| Over-investment in premises | Capital strain; ROI uncertainty | Separate operational must-fix from deferred nice-to-haves |
