# Clinic Profiles

**Purpose:** Site-specific context for Cape Town and London
**Prepared for:** Directors/Board
**Status:** Confidential Internal Document

## Cape Town

### Current State

Cape Town is Sanctura's most established clinic and serves as the foundation for the long-term oncology vision. The clinic offers:

- Integrative oncology
- Hyperthermia (mEHT)
- HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy)
- Metabolic medicine
- Infusion-based treatments

**Medical Structure:** A full-time Medical Officer (MO) is in place, with capabilities and confidence being actively developed to enable independent new patient management.

**Current Constraint:** The CEO continues to shoulder a disproportionate share of new patient intake, limiting operational scalability and strategic focus.

### Key Strategic Realities

| Asset/Opportunity | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Hyperthermia | High-margin, underutilised asset |
| HBOT integration | Significant upcoming revenue and clinical opportunity |
| Dr. Louis Kathan partnership | Transformative oncology expansion project |
| 10 Dorp Street | Commercial and clinical build-out opportunity |

### H1 2026 Focus (Speed 1)

- **MO independence development:** Transition routine new-patient onboarding and case management to MO; reserve CEO for specialised, complex, or VIP cases
- **Nursing capacity uplift:** Support expanded treatment capacity
- **Protocol refinement:** Ensure scalability without diluting personalisation
- **Operational coordination:** Improve nursing and administrative workflows

### Long-Term Development Path (Speed 2)

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Oncology hub foundation | Kathan engagement, chemotherapy licensing groundwork |
| Facility expansion | 10 Dorp Street build-out |
| Advanced capabilities | Radiation therapy bunker (long-lead regulatory and capital) |
| Service integration | Regenerative medicine, expanded metabolic protocols |

### Operational Constraints to Address

- Office space is tight; practice manager lacks dedicated workspace
- Premises improvements should prioritise operational must-fix items over aesthetic upgrades
- Break-even discipline required before significant capital investment

## London

### Current State

London has demonstrated strong demand, particularly among VIP and international patients. Lead generation is robust, but conversion and long-term case continuity are limited by:

- Operational discontinuity
- Leadership gaps
- Uneven patient management processes

**Medical Structure:** The clinic relies on a part-time Medical Officer, which prevents consistent coverage and limits:
- Capacity for new patient onboarding
- Delivery of a predictable, high-touch VIP experience
- CEO's ability to reduce operational involvement

### Critical Constraints

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Part-time MO | Inconsistent coverage; limited clinical capacity |
| No full-time operational leadership | Execution gaps; issue escalation to CEO |
| Invoicing and payment gaps | Revenue leakage; patient financial friction |
| Limited nursing/coordination capacity | Continuity of care challenges |

### H1 2026 Focus (Speed 1)

| Initiative | Objective |
|------------|-----------|
| MO structure redesign | Sustainable clinical coverage enabling growth |
| Leadership hire/stabilisation | Full-time operational accountability |
| Payment flow repair | Invoicing, collections, patient financial processes |
| Billing discipline | End-of-February milestone for operational billing |
| Clinical governance | Role clarity, training sign-off, protocol consistency |

### Long-Term Growth Model (Speed 2)

**Positioning:** VIP-ready metropolitan clinic with:
- Reliable conversion from strong lead flow
- Consistent, high-touch patient experience
- Predictable financial performance
- Platform for international patient growth

**Success Indicators:**
- Full-time MO and operational leadership in place
- Conversion rates materially improved
- Patient financial flows streamlined
- CEO capacity released for strategic focus

### Leadership Requirements

The UK leadership function requires clarity across:

| Role | Accountability |
|------|---------------|
| Medical Officer | Clinical standards, protocol consistency, patient safety |
| Operations Lead | Day-to-day execution, issue triage, staff coordination |
| CEO | Strategic direction, VIP/complex cases, relationship building |

A functioning UK leadership operating system includes:
- Daily/weekly huddles
- Issue triage and action board
- Cross-site alignment with Cape Town

| Dimension | Cape Town | London |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Maturity** | Most established | High demand, operational gaps |
