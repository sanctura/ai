# Sanctura 2026 Strategy: Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Directors/Board

## Where We Are Today

Sanctura enters 2026 with validated clinical demand across Cape Town and London, a proven integrative oncology and metabolic medicine model, and clear market opportunity. However, operational and financial constraints—leadership gaps, billing inconsistencies, and conversion leakage—limit our ability to scale at the pace required.

The organisation is transitioning from a founder-driven structure into a professionally governed, multi-site healthcare group.

## The Two-Speed Strategy

We are adopting a **Two-Speed Strategy** to balance immediate stabilisation with long-term strategic ambition:

| Speed | Focus | Timeframe |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Speed 1** | Stabilise & Strengthen | Jan–July 2026 |
| **Speed 2** | Strategic Build & Expansion | Aug 2026–Dec 2028 |

This approach recognises that attempting large-scale strategic initiatives without first resolving operational foundations will result in execution dilution and continued under-performance.

## H1 2026 Priorities (Speed 1)

The next six months focus on meeting revenue targets with margin discipline. Our constraint has shifted from capacity to conversion—we expect approximately 5× clinic capacity by late February.

**Five Priority Areas:**

1. **Finance:** Billing discipline, pricing standardisation, CFO onboarding, margin tracking
2. **Revenue Engine:** Conversion mechanics (closer function, protocol clarity), controlled marketing dial-up, mEHT/HBOT utilisation
3. **UK Medical Officer:** Clear accountability, clinical governance, protocol consistency
4. **Compliance:** CQC readiness, SOPs, training certification, governance committee
5. **UK Leadership:** Operational execution, issue triage, cross-site alignment

**Critical Path:** Billing → Closer function → Protocol clarity → Training → Marketing dial-up

## Expected Outcomes by End of 2026

- Billing is consistent, timely, and policy-driven
- Conversion rates have materially improved with clear accountability
- Both clinics have stable clinical and operational leadership
- Financial visibility enables informed capital allocation decisions
- Foundation is set for oncology hub development and international expansion

## Critical Risks and Dependencies

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Top-of-funnel growth without conversion capacity | Increased busyness without proportional revenue |
| Inconsistent staff guidance | Patient trust erosion and conversion leakage |
| Billing and policy gaps | Revenue leakage and administrative drag |
| Over-investment in premises before ROI discipline | Capital strain without clear return |
