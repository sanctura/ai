# CFO Workshop — One-Pager

## Executive Summary
Sanctura enters 2026 at a pivotal transition point: the organisation has strong clinical demand and validated services across Cape Town and London, yet operational and financial constraints limit its ability to scale.

Our goal for this workshop is to align with the Fractional CFO on the financial architecture, stabilisation priorities, and capital allocation principles required to support both short-term operational stability and long-term strategic growth.

The CFO’s role will be central in bringing financial clarity, discipline, and structure to the next phase of Sanctura’s evolution.

# Fractional CFO Workshop — Briefing

## Purpose of This Session
To align on Sanctura’s financial architecture, stabilisation priorities, and the long-term strategic direction that will guide capital allocation, forecasting, and operational decision-making through 2026–2028.

## 1. Who We Are
Sanctura operates integrated oncology and metabolic medicine clinics in Cape Town and London, with a growing international patient base.

Our model blends medical precision, metabolic interventions, hyperthermia, HBOT, and advanced infusion therapy — all under a unified clinical philosophy and brand.

We are now transitioning from a founder-driven organisation into a professionally structured, dual-market healthcare group.

## 2. Our Strategic Vision (2026–2028)
Sanctura’s ambition is to build a globally credible, clinically advanced integrative oncology ecosystem, anchored in:

* **Cape Town:** A flagship integrated oncology hub with radiation, hyperthermia, HBOT, chemotherapy licensing, and regenerative medicine integrated into a seamless long-term clinical pathway.
* **London:** A stable, VIP-ready metropolitan clinic built on reliable clinical capacity, strong operational leadership, and consistent patient conversion and continuity.
* **Group-Level Infrastructure:** A unified technology platform, clean financial architecture, predictable operational processes, and a scalable governance model.

## 3. Our Phase Plan — The Two-Speed Strategy

### Speed 1: Stabilise & Strengthen (Jan–July 2026)
Build the operational and financial foundation required for safe scale. Key focus areas:

## 5. What We Want to Achieve Together (Workshop Outcomes)
By the end of the workshop, we aim to align on:
* The financial priorities for the next 6 months.
* The information architecture required for accurate forecasting.
* The cost and revenue levers we must quantify.
* The CFO’s role within the Two-Speed Strategy.
* The roadmap for financial clarity and decision-making discipline.

## Closing Message
Sanctura has extraordinary clinical potential and strong market demand. With the right financial architecture and a disciplined roadmap, we can stabilise operations, expand our oncology capability, and position Sanctura as a leader in integrative oncology globally.

Tomorrow’s session is the foundation of that journey.
