# Sanctura Group Strategic Plan (2026–2028)

**Prepared by:** Grant Merwitz, CTO/CCO (Chief Technology Officer / Chief Commercial Officer)  
**Status:** Confidential Internal Document

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sanctura enters 2026 in a position of significant strategic opportunity and operational constraint. Following successful validation of its integrative oncology and metabolic medicine model in both Cape Town and London, the organisation is now positioned to shift from foundational development to disciplined scale.

However, gaps in leadership capacity, financial structure, operational systems, and clinical bandwidth constrain the organisation’s ability to progress at the pace required. The coming year requires a decisive, structured approach that balances stabilisation activities with the design of long-term strategic platforms.

This Strategic Plan adopts a **Two-Speed Strategy** to harmonise the differing expectations of Directors and the operational realities of the clinics.

* **Speed 1 (Jan–July 2026): Stabilize & Strengthen** – resolving operational bottlenecks, building leadership, repairing systems, and ensuring clinical readiness.
* **Speed 2 (Aug 2026–Dec 2028): Strategic Build & Expansion** – oncology development, new technology platforms, international expansion, and commercial scale-up.

A formal portfolio governance system, led by the CTO/CCO, will ensure all initiatives are evaluated, sequenced, and executed with discipline. Only a limited set of Tier 1 initiatives will be active concurrently.

By 2028, Sanctura aims to operate a stable, technologically enabled, multi-country integrative oncology ecosystem with strong financial frameworks, clinical depth, and clear pathways for expansion.

## 2. Strategic Context

### 2.1 Cape Town Clinical and Operational Context
Cape Town is Sanctura’s most established clinic and serves as the foundation for the long-term oncology vision. The clinic offers integrative oncology, hyperthermia, metabolic medicine, and infusion-based treatments.

The core medical structure is now supported by a full-time Medical Officer (MO), whose capabilities and confidence are being actively developed to enable the clinic to take on and manage new patients independently. At present, the CEO continues to shoulder a disproportionate share of new patient intake, which limits operational scalability and constrains his ability to focus on London and group-level strategic priorities.

The objective for 2026 is to transition routine new-patient onboarding and case management to the MO, reserving the CEO’s involvement for specialized, complex, or VIP cases.

**Key Strategic Realities:**
* Hyperthermia remains a high-margin, underutilized asset.
* HBOT integration provides a significant upcoming revenue and clinical opportunity.
* Oncology expansion, particularly through the involvement of Dr. Louis Kathan and the development of 10 Dorp Street, is the transformative project for the region.
* Clinical protocols require further refinement to ensure scalability without diluting personalisation.
* Short-term focus must be on strengthening the MO-led clinical model, improving nursing and operational coordination, and completing essential operational and financial system transitions.

### 2.2 London Clinical and Operational Context
London has demonstrated strong demand—particularly among VIP and international patients. Lead generation is robust, but conversion and long-term case continuity are limited by operational discontinuity, leadership gaps, and uneven patient management processes.

A central constraint is the clinical staffing model: the clinic currently relies on a part-time Medical Officer, which prevents consistent coverage, limits capacity for new patient onboarding, and constrains the delivery of a predictable, high-touch VIP experience. A full-time MO is essential to stabilise the clinical workload, establish continuity of care, and support the CEO’s ability to reduce operational involvement.

**Critical Constraints:**
* Absence of full-time operational leadership.
* Unsustainable MO structure requiring redesign.
* Gaps in invoicing, payments, and overall patient financial flows.
* Limited nursing and coordination capacity impacting continuity of care.

Fixing London’s operating model is essential to unlocking its commercial potential and supporting international reputation growth.

### 2.3 Group-Level Organisational and Financial Context
Sanctura is transitioning from a founder-driven organisation into a structured, multi-site healthcare entity. This transition requires formal governance, clearer decision rights, data consistency, and professionalised financial management.

* Historical financial complexity, limited forecasting capability, and inconsistent costing methodologies limit decision clarity.
* Migration to Xero, engagement of a fractional CFO, and implementation of a unified project portfolio system are critical.
* Technology maturity varies across sites. Adoption of Semble, development of a Patient Portal, automation tooling, and commercial e-commerce engine are central to the next wave of organizational scale.

## 3. Two-Speed Strategy Architecture

### 3.1 Overview
The Two-Speed Strategy provides a structured approach to stabilising core operations while preparing and sequencing strategic initiatives that will define Sanctura’s competitive position through 2028.

### 3.2 Speed 1: Stabilise & Strengthen (Jan–July 2026)
The Speed 1 phase focuses on restoring operational foundations, leadership stability, and financial clarity.

**Key Objectives:**
* London leadership hire and MO structure redesign.
* London payment, invoicing, and patient flow fixes.
* Cape Town MO independence development and nursing uplift.
* Hyperthermia and HBOT utilization optimization.
* Completion of Xero migration and cost-modelling architecture.
* Implementation of portfolio management governance.

Success in Speed 1 establishes preconditions for strategic acceleration.

### 3.3 Speed 2: Strategic Build & Expansion (Aug 2026 – Dec 2028)
Speed 2 focuses on long-term value creation and competitive differentiation.

**Key Initiatives:**
* Cape Town oncology hub development and oncologist engagement.
* 10 Dorp Street commercial and clinical build-out.
* Semble evaluation and rollout (if approved).
* Patient Portal app, automations, and digital patient engagement.
* E-commerce platform for supplements and services.
* HydroVitality, Randox and external product innovation.
* International clinic feasibility assessments (Dublin, NL, Portugal, KZN, UAE).

Speed 2 initiatives will be sequenced based on capacity, capital availability, and Board approval.
