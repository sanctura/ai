## 2026 Focus Areas Source Document

### Six-month goal: meet revenue targets (with margin discipline)

This document is a *source of truth* capturing the “blocks” from the strategy whiteboard plus the key discussion points from the session transcript. It is intentionally more detailed than a future executive summary, so it can be distilled later.

**Legend (from the whiteboard):**

* **Priority (pink blocks):** directly impact the next six months’ ability to meet revenue targets.
* **Part-priority (blue block):** some items directly impact the six-month goal; others are longer-horizon and should be selectively prioritised.

**Core framing from the discussion (important):**

* The team explicitly distinguished “revenue targets” from **margin/cost targets**, noting that hitting revenue without margin is not success. 
* The group expects **capacity to increase materially (c. 5×)** in both UK and SA by mid/late February, which shifts the constraint from “capacity” to “filling and converting the funnel,” and operational execution (billing, policies, training). 
* There was a strong emphasis that **conversion mechanics (“closer”, quotes, protocols clarity)** are immediate revenue levers, and that system efficiency must be split into “six-month conversion levers” vs “nice-to-have / 6+ month” items.

## 1) Revenue engine model for the next six months

### 1.1 The constraint has moved: capacity → conversion & operations

The discussion indicates the business is approaching a step-change in capacity (nurses onboarding, reception staffing, operational leadership, lender/clinician capacity). By late February, the business expects **~5× clinic capacity** versus late 2025 in both UK and SA. 

**Implication:** The six-month plan must prioritise:

1. **Conversion** (closing, quoting, protocols clarity, follow-up flow)
2. **Billing & collections execution** (policy + tooling + discipline)
3. **Marketing dial** (increasing demand only as fast as conversion capacity can process it) 
4. **Training & compliance** (to deliver consistent patient experience and reduce leakage from conflicting staff guidance) 

### 1.2 “Marketing dial” principle

The team described marketing as a controllable “dial”: you can increase spend/content, but costs can rise quickly if done indiscriminately. 
They also flagged a prior pattern: increased top-of-funnel interest created busyness without proportional revenue improvement (busyness up ~100%, revenue up only ~5–10%), implying leakage in conversion and/or operational throughput. 

**Guiding principle:** *Increase marketing only in lockstep with proven conversion throughput.*

## 2) Priority blocks (pink): what they mean, and how they drive six-month results

## 2.1 Finance (Priority)

**Whiteboard sub-items:**

* Billing
* CFO
* Pharmacy profit/efficiency
* Pricing
* Retrospective audit
* Immediate needs
* Invoicing controls
* Long term needs

### What “good” looks like in six months

**Outcome targets (definition-level, not numeric):**

* Billing is consistent, timely, policy-driven, and friction-minimised for patients.
* Pricing & invoicing are standardised enough to reduce ad-hoc variance and internal confusion.
* Margin discipline is visible and tracked (revenue alone is insufficient). 

### Key initiatives to elaborate into workstreams

1. **Billing system + weekly discipline**

   * The transcript stresses “by end of February” billing must be operationally in place: “billing system, patients paying, etc, sorted out.” 
   * Operational policy direction discussed: payment rules, reconciling weekly, and collecting upfront for next week’s treatment, executed with confidence and consistency. 
   * **Deliverables**

     * Billing SOP (patient payment timing, deposits, refunds/credits, discounts, medical aid handling).
     * Weekly billing cadence: reconciliation workflow, owner, exceptions path.
     * Reporting: AR ageing, weekly collections, write-offs, discounts given, exception log.

2. **Quote → invoice linkage**

   * The group explicitly connected protocols/quotes to conversion and asked whether this sits under “finances quoting and invoicing.” 
   * **Deliverables**

     * Standard quote templates mapped to protocol components (and optional add-ons).
     * Versioning rules (avoid confusion when protocol changes).
     * “Explainability layer”: short plain-English rationale and schedule.

3. **Margin & cost tracking**

   * Explicitly: “hold ourselves honest” by tracking costs/margin alongside revenue. 
   * **Deliverables**

     * Weekly view: revenue, direct costs, contribution margin estimate, marketing spend, staffing costs, gross margin trend.
     * Decision thresholds: when to reduce spend vs when to invest for growth.

4. **Pharmacy profit/efficiency**

   * On the board, but not elaborated in transcript. In the six-month window, treat as:

     * SKU rationalisation and pricing consistency
     * Stock control and shrink minimisation
     * Clear “attach” rules (what is routinely bundled/upsold in protocols)

---

## 2.2 Revenue – 6 months (Priority)

**Whiteboard sub-items:**

* Conversion
* Marketing
* Capacity mEHT / HBOT (as written)

### 2.2.1 Conversion (primary lever)

The transcript is very clear: conversion is a top six-month priority; “closer” and “well-explained quote/protocol” are directly linked to revenue. 

**Key conversion components**

1. **Closer function**

   * The closer should follow a decision flow: when to send educational assets (e.g., hypothermia video), when to schedule a 10-minute follow-up, and when to escalate to a medical question. 
   * The discussion notes that most closes can be handled by a trained closer post-consult; exceptions are medical nuance. 
   * **Deliverables**

     * Closer playbook: scripts, branching logic, FAQ library, escalation rules.
     * “10-minute follow-up” protocol: booking rules, ownership, documentation.
     * QA loop: review a sample of calls weekly for improvement.

2. **Protocol clarity + “explainability”**

   * The team described protocols as “tricky,” and ambiguity reduces confidence and conversion. 
   * A specific example: generating a clear multi-paragraph explanation plus a table improved conversion of a difficult patient. 
   * **Deliverables**

     * Standard “take-home protocol summary” format (weekly schedule + rationale + expected experience).
     * Internal training: staff must understand why each component exists to explain it consistently.

3. **Conversion metrics**

   * Conversion rate by stage (enquiry → consult → quoted → started)
   * Time-to-start
   * Drop-off reasons (cost, confusion, timing, trust, medical uncertainty)

### 2.2.2 Marketing (demand generation with a controlled dial)

The group expects marketing may require incremental spend and must be tuned carefully to avoid runaway costs. 

**Deliverables**

* Content catalogue: what exists, what’s missing, where it’s published.
* Provider outreach pack (for referring clinicians/partners): concise, credible, and consistent.
* “Month 3 dial-up” plan: explicitly suggested as a timing concept once systems and closing are stable. 

### 2.2.3 Capacity (mEHT / HBOT)

This appears on the whiteboard as a capacity lever, likely reflecting:

* machine utilisation targets (mEHT/HBOT)
* scheduling throughput
* staffing competency on machines

Because capacity is expected to expand materially, the operational risk becomes *under-utilisation* if conversion doesn’t keep up.

## 2.3 Medical Officer UK (Priority)

**Whiteboard sub-items:**

* Direction
* Roles/responsibilities, medical leadership, revenue targets

### Interpretation (six-month relevance)

This block is about ensuring the UK clinical leadership function is:

* clearly accountable for clinical standards and consistency (affects conversion + retention),
* aligned to revenue targets without compromising compliance/safety.

**Key deliverables**

* Role clarity: what the Medical Officer owns vs what sits with CEO/ops/clinical leads.
* Clinical governance cadence: weekly/biweekly review of clinical incidents, patient feedback, protocol deviations.
* Training sign-off: ensuring staff competency to deliver protocols consistently (ties directly to the training block).

---

## 2.4 Compliance (Priority)

**Whiteboard sub-items:**

* PM – CPT, PM – LND
* Insurance, SOPs, CQC training
* Governance committee

### What the transcript adds

* Training certificates and “visible compliance” were emphasised: certificates should be displayed (e.g., wall by the lift in the UK). 
* The team distinguished compliance from training, but noted both matter; patients notice inconsistency and it creates reputational and conversion risk. 

**Deliverables**

* Compliance dashboard: CQC readiness items, insurance renewals, SOP status, incident log.
* Certificate tracking: what training completed, certificates received, what’s outstanding, what must be displayed. 
* Governance committee operating rhythm: agenda template, decisions log, assigned actions.

---

## 2.5 Mohammed UK (Priority)

**Whiteboard sub-items:**

* UK leadership
* Feasibilities
* 3rd party suppliers
* Oxy hydroviability / Panaxea / etc (as written)
* Own range supplements

### Interpretation (six-month relevance)

This appears to group “UK operational leadership” plus feasibility exploration and supply-side initiatives.

From the transcript: leadership investment is mentioned as improving operational efficiency and enabling others to perform better. 

**Deliverables**

* UK leadership operating system:

  * daily/weekly huddles
  * issue triage and action board
  * cross-site alignment (UK/SA)
* Feasibility pipeline:

  * list of feasibility topics, owner, decision date, required data
* Supplier management:

  * supplier list, SLA expectations, pricing, reliability metrics
* Own-range supplements:

  * product scope, compliance requirements, margin model, go/no-go gates

---

## 3) Part-priority block (blue): System Efficiency

This block is explicitly flagged in discussion as “needs splitting” into:

* items that affect immediate six-month revenue (conversion + billing + clarity), and
* items that are valuable but longer-horizon. 

### 3.1 System Efficiency items on the whiteboard

* Medical instructions (formal process)
* Closer (convert customer)
* Script (record / request / access)
* Welcome pack
* Notes / messaging / journey
* Review / testimonials / feedback
* Payment terms
* Research questionnaire
* Packages
* Complimentary services
* System solution
* Blood reviews
* Protocol for patients
* Consents / CancerIQ / indemnities
* Value-add patient packages (box on board)
* “Semble magnet system” (as written)
* Integration AI
* Take-home protocol summary

### 3.2 Six-month “must-do” subset (direct revenue impact)

1. **Closer function & decision flow** 
2. **Take-home protocol summary + protocol clarity** (explicitly tied to conversion) 
3. **Payment terms + billing execution discipline** 
4. **Medical instructions / formal process**

   * Purpose: reduce variation; prevent “conflicting guidance” patients reported. 
5. **Review/testimonials/feedback loop**

   * Near-term goal: capture proof points that improve conversion; fix experience issues quickly.

### 3.3 Longer-horizon subset (6 months+ unless “easy wins”)

These may still happen if low effort, but should not distract critical path:

* Research questionnaire (acknowledged as “maybe six months plus”) 
* Welcome pack (debated: useful but potentially expensive; may be best after commitment to a protocol) 
* Broader “packages” expansion (beyond conversion-critical quoting)
* “System solution” re-platforming (unless it removes a major bottleneck fast)

### 3.4 Complimentary services + “Maria V virtual”

The transcript mentions “Maria V” providing virtual support for complementary services (context indicates Cape Town/online access), suggesting a scalable add-on that could enhance patient experience and/or protocol adherence. 

**Six-month angle:** ensure it is packaged and explained in a way that supports conversion and retention (e.g., positioned as value-add tied to protocols rather than an operational side quest).

---

## 4) Non-priority blocks (not highlighted as direct six-month revenue levers)

These are still important, but based on the whiteboard they were not flagged as immediate six-month drivers. Where relevant, I’ve noted linkages back to revenue targets.

## 4.1 Marketing (box: CMO)

Although the marketing activity itself is a key lever, the existence of a “CMO” sub-item suggests a leadership/ownership gap.

**Work to define**

* What CMO owns (strategy, channel execution, reporting, budget)
* KPI set: CAC proxy, consult volume, conversion contribution, channel ROI
* Asset pipeline: educational content to support the closer flow 

---

## 4.2 Training (Nursing, Medical Officer, Protocols/Sanctura Certificate, ACLS/BLS)

The transcript strongly reinforces training as both:

* a quality/safety requirement, and
* a revenue requirement (patients lose trust when staff guidance conflicts). 

Specific training topics referenced:

* upskilling nurses, exams, ACLS/BLS 
* need for certificates and visibility of credentials 
* addressing the gap between highly experienced staff and newer staff who only had slides/online training 

**Six-month deliverables**

* Competency map per role (nursing, reception/closer, medical officer)
* Protocol training cadence (weekly refreshers + assessed competence)
* Certification tracker (complete → certificate received → displayed) 

---

## 4.3 CEO (Relationship building; Referrals org; Affiliate B2B)

The transcript adds detail:

* “Relationship building” and referrals are an explicit workstream: organisations and referral doctors to re-engage; plus affiliated orgs (example given: “Lloyds at home”) who wanted to refer and were not responded to. 

**Six-month deliverables**

* Target list: referral doctors + organisations (tiered)
* Outreach system: cadence, owner, follow-ups, conversion tracking
* Partner referral pathway: how referrals are handled, turnaround time, feedback loop

---

## 4.4 Premises Upgrade (Water features; Astro turf; Logo in entrance; Chemo upgrades; Kathan office; Practice manager; “future strategy session required”)

The transcript is rich here:

* Desired upgrades include logo/branding on entry, garden/drain maintenance, astro turf, colour scheme, HBOT infographic board, VIP room, group classes/exercise classes, and more. 
* Strong guidance: avoid “huge changes”; focus on small, high-impact experiential improvements; consider bigger items only after break-even and if ROI-justified (e.g., water feature cost/value discussion). 
* Practical constraint: Cape Town office space is tight; practice manager lacks a place to sit—this is operationally significant. 

**Six-month approach**

* Separate into:

  1. **Operational must-fix** (space allocation, practice manager workspace, signage/wayfinding that reduces friction)
  2. **Conversion experience upgrades** (small changes that elevate perceived quality)
  3. **Deferred nice-to-haves** (water feature tier, VIP build-out)

---

## 4.5 Kathan Integration (Chemo license; RT bunker; Dorp Street; Business plan; Consulting rooms)

This looks like a strategic integration/expansion stream. The transcript references “chemotherapy license” as a topic that needs changes/decisions. 

**Six-month interpretation**

* Define what *must* be achieved in six months vs what is longer-horizon (licensing milestones can be long-lead).
* Build a milestone plan:

  * licensing requirements & timeline
  * facility requirements (RT bunker, consulting rooms)
  * business plan assumptions and staged investment gates

---

## 4.6 High level governance (Medical board; Treatments offered; Modalities; Medical directors; Advisors)

This is likely the formal structure ensuring clinical and organisational governance.

**Six-month linkage**

* A strong governance posture can support:

  * compliance readiness,
  * provider confidence and referrals,
  * consistent clinical offerings (reducing internal drift and mixed messaging).

---

## 4.7 Staff incentives (KPIs; motivations/drivers)

Not discussed in depth in transcript, but it can materially affect execution.

**Six-month recommendation (as a source-level expansion)**

* Use incentives to reinforce:

  * conversion throughput (without compromising clinical appropriateness),
  * billing discipline,
  * patient satisfaction/feedback capture,
  * training completion and protocol adherence.

---

## 5) Cross-cutting decisions & risks to surface for the executive summary later

### 5.1 Decide the “critical path” for six months

Based on the discussion, a plausible critical path is:

1. Billing system + payment terms execution (end of Feb) 
2. Closer function + decision flow + 10-minute follow-ups 
3. Protocol clarity + take-home summaries (reduce confusion, increase conversion) 
4. Training & certificate visibility + consistency 
5. Marketing dial-up only once conversion is stable 

### 5.2 Biggest risks explicitly implied

* **Top-of-funnel growth without conversion capacity** (busyness without revenue) 
* **Inconsistent staff guidance** harming patient trust and conversion 
* **Billing/policy inconsistency** creating leakage and admin drag 
* **Over-investing in premises upgrades** before break-even or without ROI discipline
