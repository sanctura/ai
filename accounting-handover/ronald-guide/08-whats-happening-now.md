# What's Happening Right Now

As of your start date (9 February 2026), here's the current state of play.

---

## The Big Picture

Alida Wiese, the Financial Manager, resigned on 26 January 2026. Her last day is **23 February 2026**. You have a 2-week overlap with her (9-23 Feb). The entire organisation is in transition mode.

## Invoicing Transformation - Already In Progress

This is the most visible change happening right now. The business has moved from a centralised invoicing model (where Alida created all invoices) to a **decentralised model** where staff invoice at point of service.

### What's Already Happened
- **28 January:** Xero went live for invoicing and quoting
- **Week 1 (26 Jan - 1 Feb):** Xero configured, templates set up, users added, billing manual drafted
- **Week 2 (3-7 Feb):** Staff training (reception and nurses) is happening **this week**
- **Go-live target:** Friday 7 February - staff creating real invoices

### How It Works Now

| Role | What They Invoice | Where |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Nurses | IVs, treatments, medications | At point of delivery |
| Reception | Consultations, supplements | At the front desk |
| Reception | Patient statement | Print at patient exit |

### Who's Running It

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| Alida | Built the foundation (Week 1), led training (Week 2) |
| Kyle | Rollout lead for Cape Town - running his team from this week |
| Amanda | Rollout lead for UK - running her team from this week |

### Where You Fit In

Your role in invoicing is **audit and quality control**, not creation:
- From Week 3 onwards (next week), Kyle and Amanda run their teams independently
- Alida drops to ~30% support on invoicing, freeing her for handover to you
- You should start observing the invoicing process this week to understand it
- Post-departure, you own the weekly invoicing audit (checking accuracy and completeness)

## Current State of the Books

**Xero bookkeeping:** All three organisations (Inc, Saint Raphael, Sanctura Ltd) were brought up to date for the current financial year before Xero went live.

Ask Alida to confirm:
- Are the books still current as of today?
- Are there any outstanding reconciliation items?
- What's the backlog (if any)?

## Urgent / Time-Sensitive Items

### Before Alida Leaves (23 Feb)

| Annual forecast for FY27 | All | Due February | HIGH |

| File handover (Alida's drive) | All | Must happen before 23 Feb | CRITICAL |

### Coming Up in February/March

| Item | Due | Detail |

| February payroll data | ~20 Feb | You'll need to prepare this for Inaura and Kinari |
| VAT period (Jan-Feb) | End March | Inaura calculates, you review, James releases |

### Next Week (Week 3: 10-14 Feb)
- Kyle and Amanda run their teams independently

- Remaining ~70% of Alida's time should be focused on **you**

### Week 4 (17-23 Feb) - Alida's Last Week
- Teams should be fully independent on invoicing
- Alida available for edge cases only (~10%)
- Most of Alida's time available for final knowledge transfer to you
- Stock count ~20-22 Feb
- **23 Feb: Alida's last day**

### Post-Departure (24 Feb onwards)
- You own the weekly invoicing audit

## What Alida Is Working On Right Now

As of this week, Alida is splitting her time approximately:

| Activity | % Time | Detail |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Invoicing rollout support | ~30% | Training support, troubleshooting (winding down) |
| Handover to you | ~50% | Knowledge transfer, process walkthroughs |
| BAU operations | ~20% | Things that still need doing (payments, reconciliation) |

This split should shift more towards handover as the invoicing rollout stabilises.

## Open Questions Still Being Resolved

| Question | Owner | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| UBO submissions - who owns, when next due? | Grant | TBD |
| Supplier invoice destination - which mailbox? | Grant + Alida | Being resolved |
| Pricing source of truth - MedPrax vs Xero? | Grant + Alida | Being resolved |
| Facility fee rules - when does the >2 hour rule apply? | Alida | Being resolved |

Don't worry about solving these yet - just be aware they're open. Grant will brief you as they're resolved.
