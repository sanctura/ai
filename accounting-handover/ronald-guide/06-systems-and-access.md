## Xero - Primary Accounting Platform

**What it does:** Bookkeeping, invoicing, quoting, bank reconciliation, supplier management, financial reporting.

**Your organisations:**

| Organisation | Entity | Region | Your Role |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Dr James La Porta Inc | Medical practice | SA | Full bookkeeping |
| Saint Raphael | Management company | SA | Full bookkeeping |
| Sanctura Limited | UK clinic | UK | Full bookkeeping |

**What you'll do in Xero:**
- Record and categorise transactions
- Reconcile bank feeds
- Manage supplier invoices and bills
- Run reports (P&L, balance sheet, aged receivables, aged payables)
- Audit invoices created by staff (decentralized invoicing model)
- Prepare data for management accounts

**What you won't do in Xero:**
- Create patient invoices (staff do this at point of service)
- Create quotes (staff do this)

**Current state:** All three organisations are up to date for the current financial year (confirmed by Alida as of January 2026).

**Supporting documents:** Largely uploaded to Xero. Some additional files on Alida's drive - ask her where everything is.

## Healthbridge - Medical Billing

## Investec Online Banking

**What it does:** SA banking for Inc and Saint Raphael.

**Your access:** None currently.

**Current users:**

| User | Level | Can Do |
|------|-------|--------|
| James | Level 4 | Everything including SARS releases |
| Alida | Lower level | Load payments, view accounts, release non-SARS |
| Yaseen | Same as Alida | Load payments, view accounts, release non-SARS |

**Note:** When Alida leaves, her access will need to be removed. The question of whether you get banking access is still open - for now, you work through Grant for payment loading.

## eFiling (SARS)

**What it does:** South African tax filing (VAT, PAYE, Income Tax).

**Your access:** None needed. Inaura has access and handles submissions.

**Your role:** Review Inaura's calculations before giving the go-ahead to submit.

## CIPC

## File Storage

### Alida's Drive
Ask Alida to show you where she keeps:
- Staff files (contracts, personal details)
- Payment schedules
- HR documentation
- Policy documents
- Anything not already on Xero

**Critical action:** Get copies of everything before 23 Feb. If it only exists on Alida's personal drive, it needs to be moved to the shared drive.

### Shared Drive
Grant has set up a shared drive for you. Use it for:
- Your working files
- Process documentation you create
- Payment schedules
- Anything that needs to be accessible to the team
