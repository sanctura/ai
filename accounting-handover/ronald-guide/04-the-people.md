# The People

## Leadership Team

### James La Porta - CEO and Lead Doctor
- **Location:** Cape Town
- **Your interaction:** Minimal day-to-day. He is the only person who can release SARS payments (VAT, Income Tax). When a SARS payment is due, you prepare the schedule, Grant loads it, and then you (or Grant) follow up with James to release.
- **Important:** James is extremely busy with clinical work. Keep your communication with him brief and purposeful. Financial updates go through Grant, not directly to James unless Grant says otherwise.

### Grant Merwitz - Managing Director (Your Boss)
- **Location:** Cape Town (travelling to London 9-11 Feb)
- **Your interaction:** Daily during handover, weekly check-ins ongoing. All escalations, decisions, and external provider contact go through Grant.
- **Background:** Recently moved from CTO to MD role. Technology background - appreciates structured, clear communication.
- **Preferred comms:** WhatsApp for quick things, email for anything that needs a record.

### Yaseen Harneker - Chief Project Officer
- **Location:** Cape Town
- **Your interaction:** Banking operations. Yaseen has Investec access and can release non-SARS payments. He's your backup contact for payment-related logistics when Grant is unavailable.
- **Important:** Yaseen has a full CPO workload. Don't overload him with financial queries - keep banking-related requests focused.

### Ricardo Delgado - Director
- **Location:** Remote (not in Cape Town)
- **Your interaction:** He reviews financial reporting - management accounts and annual forecast. He has strong financial acumen and worked closely with Alida.
- **Useful:** If you need context on historical financial decisions or reporting expectations, Ricardo is a good sounding board.

## Practice Managers

### Kyle Bennett - Practice Manager (Cape Town)
- **Location:** Cape Town - in the office
- **Your interaction:** Kyle is the invoicing rollout lead for SA. He's also your contact for stock counts, local supplier questions, and debtor disputes ("I didn't receive this" type queries).
- **Important:** Kyle does invoicing governance and training - he doesn't create invoices himself. Nurses and reception do that.

### Amanda Ross - Practice Manager (UK)
- **Location:** United Kingdom
- **Your interaction:** Amanda is Kyle's equivalent for the UK. She handles UK invoicing governance, debtor disputes, and coordinates with Kinari on day-to-day UK operations.

  - What does a typical week look like?
  - Where are all the files?
  - Who are the difficult suppliers/debtors?
  - What's the current state of the books?
  - What compliance deadlines are coming up?
  - What does she wish she'd documented better?
  - What are the things that only she knows?
