# Welcome, Ronald

**From:** Grant Merwitz, Managing Director
**Date:** 9 February 2026

Ronald,

Welcome to Sanctura and the La Porta group. I'm genuinely glad you're here - we need you.

I owe you an apology upfront: I'm on a plane to London today, which is terrible timing for your first day. I'll be back and fully available from Wednesday. In the meantime, Alida Wiese (our outgoing Financial Manager) is expecting you and knows you're starting. She is your number one priority this week and next - every hour you can spend with her is gold. She leaves on 23 February, giving you two weeks of overlap.

Yaseen Harneker (our Chief Project Officer) is also in the office and can help with anything logistical. If something is urgent and can't wait for me, call or WhatsApp me - I'll have connectivity in London.

## What I've Left You

I've prepared a set of documents in the **Welcome Docs** folder on your CFO share to give you a running start. These were generated from a variety of internal notes, meeting transcripts, and planning documents we've built up over the past few weeks - so treat them as a solid starting point rather than gospel. Some things (like the day-by-day checklist in your first week guide) are a suggested framework, not a rigid script. We'll discuss and adjust when I'm back on Wednesday.

You don't need to read everything today - start with the first few and work through the rest as time allows. The priority order is:

1. **01-your-first-week.pdf** - Read this first. A suggested guide for what to focus on each day - we can refine together.
2. **02-your-role-and-expectations.pdf** - What we need from you and what your scope looks like.
3. **03-the-business.pdf** - The entities, how they relate, and what the business does.
4. **04-the-people.pdf** - Who everyone is, what they do, and how to reach them.
5. **05-how-money-flows.pdf** - Banking, payments, and financial controls.
6. **06-systems-and-access.pdf** - The tools you'll be working in.
7. **07-service-providers.pdf** - External providers and the rules of engagement.
8. **08-whats-happening-now.pdf** - What's in flight right now, including the invoicing rollout.
9. **09-compliance-calendar.pdf** - Upcoming deadlines you need to be aware of.
10. **10-key-processes.pdf** - How the recurring financial processes work.

## The Honest Picture

We're in a transition. Alida has been our Financial Manager for many years, and she holds a lot of institutional knowledge. Some things are well-documented, others are in her head. Your first job is to extract as much of that knowledge as possible before she leaves.

The invoicing transformation project is already underway - Xero went live on 28 January and staff training is happening this week. You'll be stepping into that mid-stream.

There are also some access limitations we need to work around initially. You won't have Investec banking access, so for payment runs you'll prepare the schedules and I'll load them. We'll find a better arrangement once you're settled.

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of your first month, I want you to:
- Have absorbed everything Alida can transfer
- Understand how all the entities and systems connect
- Be running the day-to-day bookkeeping and reconciliations independently
- Have a clear picture of the compliance calendar
- Be embedded in the invoicing audit rhythm

By the end of your contract, I want:
- Clean, reliable financial operations
- Monthly management accounts by the 7th working day
- A compliance calendar that runs itself
- The transition from Inaura to Bokelman (or equivalent) underway or complete
- A recommendation on the long-term finance function structure

## My Commitment to You

I know starting a new engagement while the boss is airborne isn't ideal. Here's what I commit to:

- I will be available by WhatsApp/email even while travelling
- We will have a proper sit-down when I'm back on Wednesday
- I will make time for a weekly Friday check-in throughout your contract
- I will not leave you guessing about priorities - if you're unsure, ask

Welcome aboard. I'm looking forward to working with you.

Grant
