# Service Providers

## Important Rule

**Do not contact any external service provider directly until you have:**
1. Read through the documentation on that provider
2. Discussed your engagement plan with Grant
3. Received Grant's authorisation to make contact

This isn't about trust - it's about managing the transition carefully. These providers have existing relationships and expectations. We want your first impression to be coordinated and professional.

This is a key part of your mandate. The goal is to move towards fewer, better providers:

| Current Provider | Current Role | Target State |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Inaura | SA accounting, payroll, tax | Transition to Bokelman or equivalent (Phase 2-3) |
| Kinari | UK accounting | Continues - good relationship |
| Imperium | Secretarial, annual returns | Continues |
| Atlantic Trust | Trust admin | May transition to Bokelman (future) |
| Intersure | SA insurance | Continues |
| Ashley Page | UK insurance | Continues |

**Phase 2 (March-April):** Evaluate Bokelman, document transition plan, get Grant's approval
**Phase 3 (May-June):** Begin or complete the transition, ensure no disruption to filings
