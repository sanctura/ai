# Your Role and Expectations

## The Role

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Your Title** | Fractional CFO |
| **You Report To** | Grant Merwitz (Managing Director) |
| **Contract Period** | 9 February 2026 - 9 June 2026 |
| **Hours** | 40 hours per week |

Your full Statement of Work is available separately, but here's a plain-language summary of what we need from you and what the boundaries are.

## What We Need From You

In simple terms: **keep the financial engine running** while we figure out the long-term structure.

You are responsible for:

### Day-to-Day Operations
- Xero bookkeeping for 2 SA entities (Saint Raphael, Dr James La Porta Inc) and 1 UK entity (Sanctura Limited)
- Bank reconciliation across all SA accounts (weekly)
- Supplier invoice management (receive, log, reconcile, approve, prepare payment schedules)
- Cash flow monitoring - flag issues to Grant and James early
- Debtors reconciliation (weekly)
- Debt collection - initial contact with patients who owe money

### Reporting
- Weekly KPIs to Grant
- Monthly management accounts - by the **7th working day** at the latest, goal is as soon as possible after month-end
- Cash flow reporting
- Annual forecast (Ricardo reviews)

### Compliance
- Maintain a compliance calendar for all entities with 2-week advance warnings to Grant
- Coordinate with Inaura (SA accounting), Kinari/Capricorn Capital Services (UK accounting), and Imperium (annual returns)
- BHF and HPCSA registration (annual)
- Workman's Compensation (annual, June)
- Insurance renewal coordination with Grant

### Invoicing
- You don't create invoices - nurses and reception do that at point of service
- Your role is **audit and quality control** - review invoices weekly for accuracy and completeness

### Payroll
- Prepare and provide payroll data to Inaura (SA) and Capricorn Capital Services / Kinari (UK) monthly

### Service Provider Transition
- Facilitate the transition from Inaura and current providers to Bokelman or equivalent
- This is a Phase 2-3 deliverable (March onwards), not Day 1

## What You Cannot Do

There are some important access limitations:

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| **No Investec banking access** | You prepare payment schedules, Grant loads them into the banking platform |
| **No payment release authority** | Grant or Yaseen release non-SARS payments; James releases SARS payments |
| **No direct external provider contact** without Grant's approval | Review documentation first, propose an engagement plan to Grant, then he'll authorise contact |

These limitations are interim arrangements. We'll find better solutions as you settle in, but for now this is how it works.

## The Three Phases of Your Contract

### Phase 1: Handover & Diagnosis (Feb - Weeks 1-4)
- Absorb everything from Alida
- Support the invoicing rollout
- Take over operational control of bookkeeping and reconciliations
- Review documentation on service providers (don't contact them yet)
- Start documenting processes

### Phase 2: Stabilisation & Optimisation (Mar-Apr)
- Build a 13-week rolling cash flow forecast
- Set up the compliance calendar properly
- Start delivering monthly management accounts
- Begin evaluating Bokelman as replacement for Inaura
- Embed the weekly invoicing audit cycle

### Phase 3: Transition Planning (May-Jun)
- Complete process documentation (operations manual)
- Write a recommendation on the long-term finance structure
- Progress or complete the Inaura-to-Bokelman transition
- Ensure orderly handover to whatever comes next

## How We'll Work Together

| Rhythm | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Weekly check-in** | Every Friday - progress, blockers, priorities |
| **Month 1 review** | ~10 March - how's the handover gone? |
| **Mid-contract review** | ~10 April - are we on track? Do we extend? |
| **End-of-contract review** | ~1 June - transition readiness |

I prefer direct, honest communication. If something is broken, tell me. If you need something, ask. If you disagree with an approach, say so - that's part of why you're here.

## What Good Looks Like

By the time your contract ends, I want to be confident that:

1. Financial operations run reliably without heroics
2. We have a compliance calendar that gives us advance warning
3. Monthly accounts arrive early in the month, not late
4. The service provider landscape is cleaner (fewer, better providers)
5. There's a clear path forward - whether that's a permanent hire, your extension, or something else
6. Everything is documented so the next person (or future you) can pick it up
