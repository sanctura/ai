# Your First Week

## The Situation

- **Today is Monday 9 February 2026**
- Grant is travelling to London today - back Wednesday

## Week 2 Priority: Go Deep with Alida

Week 2 is your last full week with Alida. By the end of it, you should be able to:

- [ ] Perform a bank reconciliation independently
- [ ] Prepare a supplier payment schedule
- [ ] Understand the debtors position for each entity
- [ ] Know the compliance calendar for the next 6 months
- [ ] Have met (or at least be aware of) all key service providers
- [ ] Be comfortable navigating Xero for all 3 organisations
- [ ] Understand the invoicing audit process (what to check, how often)
- [ ] Know where to find everything (files, contacts, process notes)

**Remember:** Every question you don't ask Alida this week is a question nobody can answer after 23 Feb. Don't be shy - extract everything you can.
