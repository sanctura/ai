# Compliance Calendar

One of your key deliverables is to establish and maintain a proper compliance calendar. This document gives you the starting point - the obligations we know about. Part of your job is to fill in the gaps (exact dates, renewal dates) and build this into a working system with 2-week advance warnings to Grant.

## Building the Compliance Calendar

**Your Phase 2 deliverable:** Turn this list into a proper working calendar with:

1. Exact dates for every obligation (fill in all the TBCs above)
2. 2-week advance warnings to Grant
3. Owner assigned for each item
4. Status tracking (submitted, pending, overdue)
5. Integration with your weekly KPI reporting

**Ask Alida this week:** For every "TBC" above, get the exact date or at least the month. This is one of the most valuable things she can tell you before she leaves.
