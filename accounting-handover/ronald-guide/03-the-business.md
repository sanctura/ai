## How the Entities Relate

                    Sanctura Holdings (UK)
                         |
                         | owns
                         v
                    Sanctura Limited (UK Clinic)
                    [Kinari manages, you liaise]


    James La Porta Inc  <-------- Saint Raphael
    (Medical Practice)   services  (Management Company)
    [Revenue, medical]             [Staff, operations, assets]
         |                              |
         | linked                       | employs
         v                              v
    Trust & TTC                    All SA Staff
    [Out of scope]                 (except Mma)
```

**The key relationship to understand:** The Inc generates the revenue (patient fees). Saint Raphael provides the staff and operational infrastructure. Saint Raphael invoices the Inc (and Sanctura Holdings) for management services. This is how money moves between the entities legitimately.

## Important Distinctions

| Expense Type | Paid By | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Medical supplies, prescriptions | Inc | Medications, doctor supplies |
| Non-medical operations | Saint Raphael | Supplements, cleaning, maintenance, subscriptions, furniture, HR |
| UK operations | Sanctura Ltd | UK suppliers, UK staff, UK rent |

Getting the entity allocation right matters for tax and compliance. When in doubt, ask.

## Physical Locations

- **Cape Town, South Africa** - Main practice, where you'll be based
- **United Kingdom** - Second clinic, managed remotely with Amanda Ross as Practice Manager and Kinari providing accounting support
