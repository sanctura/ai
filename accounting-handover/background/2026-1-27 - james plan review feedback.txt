Below is a **structured, “information-base ready” data source** distilled from the transcript. It’s written so you can paste it into Notion/Confluence or turn it into JSON later.

## 1) Executive summary

A draft operating plan is being refined across **finance ops, invoicing, supplier management, debt collection, UK clinic oversight, and provider/vendor decisions**. Core themes:

* **Minimize new external providers** (avoid adding *Imperium* unless necessary).
* **Stabilize operations during a finance-lead transition** (financial manager leaving; possible CFO/fractional CFO coming in).
* **Decentralize invoicing** (nurses invoice treatments/IVs; reception invoices consultations/supplements; practice managers own the process).
* **Strengthen supplier invoice reconciliation + payment discipline** (ensure correct payments and no missed invoices).
* **Clarify leadership roles in UK operations** (Mo/Elena/Maria Vega/Amanda/Saba/etc.) and avoid role-blur between strong personalities.
* **Make a fast but controlled move to Xero** with staff training, dry runs, and a phased billing optimisation plan.

---

## 2) Entities & glossary (people, vendors, systems)

### People / roles referenced

* **Grant Merwitz**: driving plan; placeholder “Grant / new financial manager / CFO” appears in matrices.
* **Yassine**: discussed owners/assignments; intentionally not assigned in places to avoid operationalisation.
* **Kyle**: effectively represents “Practice Manager” role (not literally Kyle); delegates to team.
* **Amanda**: UK practice manager candidate; concerns about follow-through/forgetfulness; still should be given chance + system support; may own ordering execution if tested fairly.
* **Canary (Kunari/Canari)**: reception; escalation support; has **Lauren** as backup; shouldn’t be “in Wilson” (context unclear).
* **Lauren**: backup for Canary; Grant emailed her for role write-up/help.
* **Anita / Alida / Alita**: appears as manager/coordinator (supplier/payment/ordering); also source of claims about vendor pricing; associated with Atlantic Trust relationship.
* **Maria Vega**: high-value clinical/integrative skillset; *should not* be bogged down with supplier/ordering admin.
* **Maria Tan**: on-site projects (e.g., chemo port SOP implementation); needs a senior escalation path.
* **Elena**: leader in practice (UK); prior availability issues.
* **Mo (Moe)**: incoming strong leader; proposed **Founder’s Associate / ops oversight**; can design systems + monitor, but not execute daily ordering.
* **Saba (Sarba/Osaba)**: possible candidate for supplier payments / ordering execution support.
* **Dr. Ishmael (Ishmael)**: escalation/support for clinical query resolution; good relationship for debtor escalations before legal.
* **Ricardo**: mentions UK practice connection; concern about individuals vs firms.
* **Harvey**: referenced in monthly context (unclear—possibly reporting cadence).

### Vendors / service providers

* **Inora**: current provider doing VAT (bi-monthly), payroll/PAYE (monthly), income tax returns; accessible & hands-on; planned to end **June 1, 2025** (but didn’t fully exit—now a “blessing in disguise” during transition).
* **OCFO**: consultancy for fractional CFO + short-term bookkeeper/clerks; can help receive/load invoices, coordinate confirmations, schedule payments; can also help place a permanent person.
* **Imperium**: potential UBO submissions provider (not used yet); Theo at Imperium mentioned for “workman’s comps” (context unclear). Team wants to avoid adding them now.
* **Atlantic Trust**: strongly negative sentiment; irregular comms; risk; may be expensive; concerns about poor handover behavior.
* **Buckleman / Bookerman / Bocumen** (name inconsistent): intended replacement for Atlantic Trust for trust work; handover allegedly already in motion; goal: **Buckleman to be in charge by end of week** (relative date in transcript).
* **Copra**: mentioned as another element now in play (context unclear).
* **Transfarm**: example supplier (30-day account or upfront meds).

### Systems / tools

* **Xero**: target system for invoicing + potentially stock/bundles; goal go-live soon; wants simplified “baskets/bundles” for common billing.
* **HealthBridge**: current/previous billing environment referenced.
* **MedPrax / MedProx API**: pricing/code data source; Grant has an API account; compare “Healthman tariff pricing” vs loaded prices in Xero.
* **Marketplace / third-party apps**: Xero ecosystem; possible future interface/CRM/automation layer.

## 3) Decisions & operating principles (what the group aligns on)

### Provider strategy

* **Avoid adding Imperium** now; limit number of providers unless essential.
* **Do not remove Inora abruptly** while finance leadership is changing; treat changes as phased.
* **OCFO is a strong short-term candidate** to stabilize invoice handling, bookkeeping capacity, and payment scheduling.
* **Atlantic Trust change is high-risk** right now; do not change too many moving parts at once unless critical—but also frustration suggests the trust handover to Buckleman should be finalized promptly.

### Invoicing ownership model (decentralized)

* **Nurses invoice IVs / treatments.**
* **Reception invoices supplements and consultations.**
* **Reception prints a statement on patient exit.**
* **Practice managers “own” the process** (governance, training, compliance) while staff execute on the floor.

### Supplier invoice management

* Supplier invoices need a clear **inbox destination + recon workflow**:

  * Receive all invoices
  * Load into system
  * Confirm/reconcile (correct amounts, match to orders/receipts)
  * Set payment dates (pay on time but not too early)
  * Use supplier statements to cross-check missing invoices

### Debt collection approach

* Do **not** saddle the practice manager (Kyle role) with direct debt-chasing if it clashes with role/personality and risks destabilizing operational change.
* Debt collection should have:

  * **Primary owner** (likely UK: Amanda + Haish; SA: TBD)
  * **Escalation path** for disputes/clinical queries (Carl coordinates; Dr Ishmael / nurses validate treatment & items delivered)
  * **Final escalation**: if non-payment persists → leadership involvement and possibly legal
* Use **Dr Ishmael** selectively when relationship-based outreach could resolve payment friction before legal escalation.

## 4) Key processes (SOP-style outlines)

### 4.1 Patient invoicing process (new model)

**Trigger:** patient visit ends / treatment delivered
**Steps:**

1. Staff identify billable items (consults, procedures, consumables, facility fees, meds).
2. **Nurses** invoice treatments/IVs; **reception** invoices consultations/supplements.
3. Reception prints statement at exit.
4. Practice manager monitors adherence and quality.
   **Controls/risks noted:**

* Training burden on staff is high during transition.
* Risk of underbilling if staff only invoice obvious items (e.g., “vitamin C bag of saline”) and miss facility fee/consumables/procedure codes.

### 4.2 Supplier invoice reconciliation & payment scheduling

**Trigger:** supplier invoice arrives (email/postal/portal)
**Steps:**

1. Central receipt (decide where supplier invoices land).
2. Log invoice (supplier, amount, due date, related order).
3. Reconcile against orders/receipts/stock usage.
4. Approve/confirm.
5. Schedule payment aligned to terms (30/60 days).
6. Monthly statement review to catch missing invoices.
   **Owner candidates:** OCFO/bookkeeper capacity + internal approver.

### 4.3 Ordering / stock replenishment workflow (problem area)

**Observed pain:** ordering inconsistent; missing follow-up; sometimes staff pay personally; “20% of what I order comes through in the UK” (per transcript).
**Proposed direction:**

* **Mo** designs and helps implement the ordering tracking system (auditability + accountability).
* **Amanda** is the leading candidate to execute ordering **daily**, but must be tested fairly with a real system in place.
* Require tracking/notifications (“CC” or workflow log) so missing orders are visible before they become crises.

### 4.4 Debt collection + query escalation workflow

**Trigger:** invoice overdue
**Steps:**

1. Outreach / reminder (non-clinical).
2. If dispute (“I didn’t receive vitamin C”) → escalate to **Carl** to investigate with nurses/Dr Ishmael/records.
3. If unresolved non-payment → leadership escalation; relationship-based call from Dr Ishmael when appropriate.
4. Legal escalation only after internal resolution attempts.

---

## 5) Xero rollout plan (timeline + phases)

### 4-week operational plan (as described)

* **Week 1:** Get everything “into Xero” (should have been done in December per transcript; now must happen immediately).
* **Week 2:** Full staff training + dry runs; decision by **Friday** whether going live.
* **Week 3:** Go live (UK + Cape Town simultaneously). Grant travels to London during week 3.
* **Week 3–4:** Departing finance leader is still present while staff operate “as if she isn’t,” but with safety net support.

### Billing system evolution (3 phases)

* **Phase 1 (Survival / Simplify):** Minimal viable baskets (e.g., “infusion fee” bundle), basic codes, laminated checklist; ensure invoices are presentable for medical aid.
* **Phase 2 (Optimise):** Improve pricing, reduce missed charges, refine bundles/packages, add rules for auditing.
* **Phase 3 (Interface/Automation):** Build easier front-end (CRM/charge sheet → stock sheet → billing), leverage Xero API/marketplace apps.

---

## 6) Billing complexity notes (important “knowledge base” items)

### “Baskets / bundles” concept

Instead of picking 6–10 line items repeatedly, create bundled items:

* Example: **Chemo/IV infusion bundle** includes consumables, trays, facility fee, management fee codes, etc.
* Still maintain stock tracking behind bundles (bundle tied to stock items).

### “Only ~20–25 codes drive most billing”

The team notes that **99% of billing** is a small set of codes (excluding meds). A printed tick sheet/checklist helps staff remember to include:

* consults
* ECG / urine / catheter items
* facility fee rules (e.g., visit longer than 2 hours)
* procedure-related consumables
* nursing procedure codes
* doctor procedure codes

### Major risk

Without structured prompts/checklists, staff will bill only the obvious meds and miss:

* facility fees
* consumable bundles
* procedure codes
* management fees

## 7) Risks, constraints, and “don’t do this now” items

### Change-management risk

* Too many simultaneous changes (new CFO, switching providers, trust handover, invoicing decentralization, Xero migration) increases failure likelihood.

### Vendor risk: Atlantic Trust

* Emails irregular, process irregular, NDA/order of operations strange; perceived as high risk.
* Handover to Buckleman is overdue and should be completed if truly ready.

### Operational capacity risk

* Staff training while still operating clinic.
* Amanda reliability concerns (forgetfulness; missed follow-ups) create anxiety unless systems expose failures early.

### Governance risk

* Strong leaders joining (Mo, Elena, Maria Vega) without defined domains may create role conflict and confusion.

---

## 8) Open questions / gaps to resolve (explicitly noted or implied)

1. **UBO submissions**: Who should own annual UBO submissions and when next due (suggested “might not be until 2027”)? Is Imperium necessary?
2. **Debt collection ownership in SA**: If UK goes to Amanda/Haish, who catches SA escalations?
3. **Supplier invoice destination**: What mailbox/inbox receives supplier invoices, and who processes/reconciles?
4. **Ordering execution**: Final decision—Amanda vs Saba vs Elena for daily ordering execution; Mo designs system but does not execute.
5. **Trust handover status**: What exactly is missing from Buckleman quote / scope? Confirm the actual “quote” vs line items with ranges.
6. **Pricing source of truth**: MedPrax/Healthman tariffs vs current HealthBridge vs new Xero price list—what is the master?
7. **Facility fee rules**: Define and codify conditions (e.g., >2 hours) into checklists/bundles.

---

## 9) Action list (operationally phrased)

### Immediate (this week)

* Finalize **supplier invoice recon workflow**: receipt → log → reconcile → approve → schedule payment.
* Confirm **invoicing role split** (nurses vs reception) and update documentation.
* Start building/printing **billing checklist** (top 20–25 codes + facility fee rules).
* Ensure **Xero product/service list** has baseline items and at least one simple infusion basket.

### Next (week 2)

* Conduct staff training + dry runs; include checklist usage and how to search/select items in Xero.
* Define **buddy/check system** (capture vs review) if needed for early weeks.

### Week 3+ (go-live)

* Monitor underbilling/overbilling patterns; refine bundles; start phase 2 optimisation backlog.
* Establish audit rules for chemo/IV billing and facility fees.

## 10) Suggested “Knowledge Base” schema (so you can store this cleanly)

You can convert the above into records using these object types:

* **People**: name, role, location (UK/SA), responsibilities, backups, concerns.
* **Vendors**: name, service category, status (current/proposed/avoid), notes, risks, next action.
* **Processes**: name, trigger, steps, owners, tools, controls, failure modes.
* **Decisions**: statement, rationale, date/meeting reference, dependencies.
* **Plans/Timelines**: phases, week-by-week milestones, go/no-go criteria.
* **Risks**: description, likelihood, impact, mitigation, owner.
* **Open Questions**: question, why it matters, owner, due date.

If you want, I can also output this same content as **JSON** (ready to import into Notion databases or a KB system) using the schema in section 10—no extra questions needed; I’ll make sensible defaults from the transcript.
