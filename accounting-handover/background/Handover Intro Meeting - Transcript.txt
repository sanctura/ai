1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:03.970
Grant Merwitz: Fantastic.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.809
Grant Merwitz: Okay, cool. So, then we maybe just…

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.149
Grant Merwitz: Start off by just listing all the things you…

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.820
Grant Merwitz: do for us, which I will then structure into, like, a document that we can then grow. I'm not,

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:36.460
Grant Merwitz: you know, I might ask you to also just, outside of this, just document, so that, you know, you maybe think of things we don't talk about. But, let's just talk a little bit about your function.

6
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.619
Grant Merwitz: If you can maybe talk with recording, I'll just take notes, all the things you would look after for this business.

7
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:52.649
Grant Merwitz: Right. So I think that, mainly if we could split it up into the different entities, and then list under each entity what it is. So we've got…

8
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.030
Grant Merwitz: UK?

9
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.729
Grant Merwitz: Okay, which is set sanctuary Limited. Sanctuary Limited?

10
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:08.140
Grant Merwitz: where I do the quoting, invoicing, supplier payments.

11
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.640
Grant Merwitz: There is some ordering of stock, mainly Berg, Mateus, which is by SOMO, And Dr. Weaver.

12
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.030
Grant Merwitz: Most of the other items have been handed over already.

13
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.010
Grant Merwitz: Huh?

14
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.420
Grant Merwitz: Canari supports me with the banking.

15
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.370
Grant Merwitz: processing payroll.

16
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.789
Grant Merwitz: Together with Lauren. Of course, if there's any changes between our man and myself, we provide her with that.

17
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.830
Grant Merwitz: Right?

18
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.210
Grant Merwitz: Intro Holdings? Just… just in the UK, sort of.

19
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:14.340
Grant Merwitz: What about, like, this Barclays card, and the balancing that, and making sure it's got money, and the ordering with the Revolut card, is that… So, Kanari is running with the Revolut card. She's got also access to the Barclays account. She keeps an eye on the balance.

20
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.460
Grant Merwitz: With vinyl.

21
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.460
Grant Merwitz: You know, and Ricardo is also always involved in those discussions, so we…

22
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.430
Grant Merwitz: Between the three of us, we all three know

23
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.359
Grant Merwitz: What's happening? Yeah, and just things that happened, like, last week, where we had the supplier invoice from Bariston Clinic, and there wasn't enough.

24
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:49.780
Grant Merwitz: funds in the bank account, like… I would need to detect that, yes. I'm sorry, the balances of the account to make sure there's cash left to spend it. And that, any spend is according to the forecast.

25
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.879
Grant Merwitz: So it does align with me to make sure that we're within budget.

26
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.900
Grant Merwitz: Sure, we have cash flow…

27
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.990
Grant Merwitz: What bank accounts are there? At this point, Barbie's debit.

28
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.900
Grant Merwitz: Then there's 2 credit cards.

29
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.869
Grant Merwitz: In Amanda and Maria's name? Under Sukla Baba.

30
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.529
Grant Merwitz: It's a Barclay… yeah, it's a Bargay credit card, but they're separate.

31
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.930
Grant Merwitz: Maria's name. Maria and Miranda, each one have one? 600 pound limit.

32
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.289
Grant Merwitz: And then, the Revolut account is still with the KYC.

33
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.739
Grant Merwitz: So this, this Barclays debit card, that is our…

34
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.779
Grant Merwitz: cash account that we pay salaries out of. And that's, the patients pay into?

35
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.409
Grant Merwitz: the registered account. Okay, then just what about the financial statements of Victoria Limited? Canario will do that.

36
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:05.040
Grant Merwitz: No, he does financial statements, what about paying off, I'm gonna,

37
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.790
Grant Merwitz: that tax. So, the company is not registered for that. The medical clinic doesn't have to do that.

38
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.930
Grant Merwitz: So, we only need to submit the income tax and the financial statements, and both of those will allow Mary to do.

39
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.830
Grant Merwitz: She's doing that, yeah.

40
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:38.340
Grant Merwitz: And, that's of zero, right? And you are. The PAYD is also processed by, PCS.

41
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.119
Grant Merwitz: what CC is? Can I… Okay. Can I read…

42
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.440
Grant Merwitz: So does Pierre Whitey, and what about series?

43
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.290
Grant Merwitz: Yeah. Fair processing failed.

44
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.650
Grant Merwitz: it's all intuitive, I had to get changes, like you said, that's right. And then…

45
00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:03.730
Grant Merwitz: It's all Xero run. So, I do the actual bookkeeping on Xero, which is all up-to-date, so she is able to do the financial statements.

46
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.290
Grant Merwitz: There might be a few balancing things that we need to do.

47
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.329
Grant Merwitz: But I'll have that ready before I go to clinical speaking.

48
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.740
Grant Merwitz: Okay, UK, holding company.

49
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.610
Grant Merwitz: that lies completely what can I really see.

50
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.949
Grant Merwitz: But accounts in zero, I don't process anyone who's spelled lies. They're like, yes, L-I.

51
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.430
Grant Merwitz: AI.

52
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.569
Grant Merwitz: Is he, isn't it? Sounds like I'm lying. Canary.

53
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:48.129
Grant Merwitz: Sits completely with no. Okay, I should say Alita has sat or views, fuse input, okay, but that's fine. I mean, of course, so…

54
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.920
Grant Merwitz: Well, I think reporting should be a separate

55
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.950
Grant Merwitz: I don't, because then it becomes the whole company.

56
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:07.129
Grant Merwitz: financial reporting as a topic for later. Okay, so that's UK Holdings Company? Yes, South Africa… You can say, increase…

57
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.950
Grant Merwitz: Porta, Inc.

58
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:26.280
Grant Merwitz: We know, of course, the invoicing, quoting, supplier reconciliation… So the invoicing comes through here? Yes. And so just say it to me like we don't know, so… So, invoicing to patients.

59
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.080
Grant Merwitz: For all treatments?

60
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.579
Grant Merwitz: That's zero.

61
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.680
Grant Merwitz: Who's done by the leader, and this has some experience. Yes.

62
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.430
Grant Merwitz: Experience… Huh?

63
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.929
Grant Merwitz: That I'm quoting comes out of zero.

64
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:51.970
Grant Merwitz: Well, yes, but under the… We always call it housing, and it was in other languages.

65
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.559
Grant Merwitz: Yes, to the patients.

66
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:04.009
Grant Merwitz: I mean, ideally, if we could have the invoicing move to zero, That's a pretty difficult.

67
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.490
Grant Merwitz: Zero coding, then supplier payments.

68
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:19.420
Grant Merwitz: Also, it's supplier reconciliation, so that… so that involves processing those statements, invoices, and making payments.

69
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.800
Grant Merwitz: Oops, I'll just show Supplier Payments and Reconciliation.

70
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.679
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, that should be fine. Okay.

71
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:33.910
Grant Merwitz: New recording.

72
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.130
Grant Merwitz: No.

73
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.670
Grant Merwitz: There are no employees in the Inc, so there's nothing I need to do.

74
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.020
Grant Merwitz: Whoa.

75
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.760
Grant Merwitz: And at this stage, Inora has access to process that.

76
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.570
Grant Merwitz: And if there was PAYE, they could do that.

77
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.410
Grant Merwitz: Income tax and financial savings.

78
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.980
Grant Merwitz: I'm very happy that they can. So they do that every two months, basically. They calculate it?

79
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.460
Grant Merwitz: and submitted through eFilm.

80
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.200
Grant Merwitz: That's cool.

81
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.819
Grant Merwitz: Anything else for Waterfall Inc?

82
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.880
Grant Merwitz: It's a big one, and we miss the…

83
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.549
Grant Merwitz: This is recalled in the previous one as well.

84
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:35.279
Grant Merwitz: Sorry, Data Recon 4% sure limited. Yeah, honey.

85
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:47.519
Grant Merwitz: Debtors recon, selection, and chasing. Yeah. I mean, that's quite non-consuming. So we do debtors recon for the ink as well, then Jason Bank?

86
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:58.160
Grant Merwitz: about financial statements for… Again, in our arm, we'll do that.

87
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.170
Grant Merwitz: Based on, yeah, based on the information we provide. And tax.

88
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.690
Grant Merwitz: income tax.

89
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.640
Grant Merwitz: And then, big notes.

90
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.829
Grant Merwitz: I also drive the stock house.

91
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.969
Grant Merwitz: So this is where we would need to make sure they have a proper stock count for the end of Fed.

92
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.430
Grant Merwitz: Bullying.

93
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:23.660
Grant Merwitz: Cool.

94
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:45.649
Grant Merwitz: trying to just make sure I'm comprehensive, that if we miss anything… Yeah, this is entirely opportunity, but the more we get now, the less you have to add to it. It's worth really doing things every day, but something pops up about, oh, that's something else, just throw it to me.

95
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.149
Grant Merwitz: to the list, okay.

96
00:09:50.600 --> 00:10:01.659
Grant Merwitz: Under the ink. Now, these are ones that… that worries me a little bit. We would probably need to put a bit of a calendar together so that we can see what the cycles are when certain submissions need to be done.

97
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.650
Grant Merwitz: But annual returns?

98
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.029
Grant Merwitz: An ultimate beneficial ownership returns.

99
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:19.450
Grant Merwitz: BHF… Registration, annual registration? Beneficial annual, beneficial returns. Yeah, that's an annual thing.

100
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:27.440
Grant Merwitz: BHF registration, Let's all practice on that. What's that, BHO stand for?

101
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:35.579
Grant Merwitz: I don't know, Andrew, did you say it before you said Pietro to me, okay. No, Pietro, that's your practice manager's number, okay.

102
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.640
Grant Merwitz: HPCSA registration annually.

103
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.890
Grant Merwitz: It was all about Jane's personal.

104
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.700
Grant Merwitz: Right. Here's the last one.

105
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.889
Grant Merwitz: Inquo James's agent. Best James's gone. I mean, she'll lose.

106
00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:00.770
Grant Merwitz: Then, insurance… Just unrelated to Canada, or subreddate it to Canada.

107
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.670
Grant Merwitz: No, this is unrelated to the medical.

108
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.680
Grant Merwitz: Insurance? Sure, I mean, I…

109
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.959
Grant Merwitz: I'll just communicate with the broker, so insurance… everything under insurance lies under me.

110
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.120
Grant Merwitz: So that is the overviewing the… policies,

111
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.110
Grant Merwitz: They could be, like, if you need any new insurance.

112
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:41.809
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, so this is something that's important for… this is something that must be done now. We've done the UK. Oh, that's put it under Simone Limited as well. I manage the insurance policies there as well.

113
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.990
Grant Merwitz: It is the broken.

114
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:53.120
Grant Merwitz: Well, you can… for essay? Well, essay, it's, into sure.

115
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:55.930
Grant Merwitz: Brian.

116
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.359
Grant Merwitz: And Patricia.

117
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:08.559
Grant Merwitz: Handfold… Inc? I mean, for… Ashum Cage? Is that the company name? It's also… yeah, that's the company name.

118
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:16.070
Grant Merwitz: And it's… it's actually… Ashley is the owner, and then there's, olivia.

119
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.980
Grant Merwitz: We have just done the reviews.

120
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.190
Grant Merwitz: Okay, then…

121
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.979
Grant Merwitz: I feel I must put in a, you know…

122
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:41.370
Grant Merwitz: pay medical officer, because we don't have a payroll. I think. It's important that the payment for the medical officer comes to the legal.

123
00:12:43.130 --> 00:13:02.770
Grant Merwitz: Another important note to make is our suppliers are mainly for prescription meds, right? So that this is where we can understand the difference between the income center valve. Anything medically related, like your doctor, your prescription medication, all those suppliers lie under the

124
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.770
Grant Merwitz: So medical aid… is medical aid related, or…

125
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.009
Grant Merwitz: So, aiming for prescription meds?

126
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:18.920
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, no, no, anything that's medically… it's to do with the doctor, anything that you can't…

127
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.599
Grant Merwitz: You know, like, supplements with 400 Centrophal, and…

128
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.579
Grant Merwitz: Anything scripted falls under there. So the doctor suddenly has to make the script.

129
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.000
Grant Merwitz: The actual medication, those things.

130
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.150
Grant Merwitz: Bye.

131
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.979
Grant Merwitz: A medical officer.

132
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:53.529
Grant Merwitz: So under this is also just making two notes, but I'll elaborate on them later, is the trust and the DTC lie under… Under the Inc.

133
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.219
Grant Merwitz: to live on.

134
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.070
Grant Merwitz: Why, dude.

135
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.420
Grant Merwitz: Might be spelled wrong, but at least it's not a lie.

136
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:17.440
Grant Merwitz: Then you've got… let's go to Saintrophal.

137
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.040
Grant Merwitz: Invoicing… What do we invoice for Sandra as well? We're invoicing the ink.

138
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.810
Grant Merwitz: And we can voice things into your holdings.

139
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.050
Grant Merwitz: Those are the two customers.

140
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.940
Grant Merwitz: of St. Johan.

141
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.480
Grant Merwitz: I will be sure to have… Do you quote them?

142
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:48.010
Grant Merwitz: No, I don't quite that, but I'll be sure to have a… The…

143
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:57.749
Grant Merwitz: I don't know how to put it, but we were revising the charges for the year, for this financial year. We should have that all balanced and correct before I go, so nobody has to look at it.

144
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.389
Grant Merwitz: Then, supplier payments, so supplier reconciliation.

145
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:15.829
Grant Merwitz: That supplier, the current… so this is for supplements, right? Well, there's a list, so I have a list, a payment…

146
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.110
Grant Merwitz: schedule.

147
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.710
Grant Merwitz: Where…

148
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:34.109
Grant Merwitz: anybody can just see which are the regular supplies that you're paying. But yes, in short, anything that has got to do with practice management, cleaning, maintenance, repairs, HR,

149
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:42.099
Grant Merwitz: Supplements… Any office expenses, subscriptions.

150
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:52.809
Grant Merwitz: assets, especially… Everything non-medical, basically. Everything non-medical, so all the assets, we try to lie with St. Rafael.

151
00:15:54.770 --> 00:16:00.639
Grant Merwitz: At this point, Centrophile also pays for our big loans, which is with TAFs.

152
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.130
Grant Merwitz: However, it's in the name of the ink.

153
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.910
Grant Merwitz: So the hypothermia Bates, I have loans on them and the ultrasound machine.

154
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.719
Grant Merwitz: And we were now looking at perhaps getting that full compressor through tabs. Second of all pays for it on behalf of Bain.

155
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.340
Grant Merwitz: Process and pay salaries, leave.

156
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.789
Grant Merwitz: You know, go to conserve leave.

157
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.859
Grant Merwitz: You consult overtime with the nurses.

158
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.860
Grant Merwitz: Overtime use, so they pay Saturdays.

159
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.570
Grant Merwitz: Central Fall pays salaries. Everyone's salaries. Salaries except Emma.

160
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:49.790
Grant Merwitz: Simple.

161
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:58.359
Grant Merwitz: And again, there's a list, it's all… so Inora has, they do the actual processing right now.

162
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.540
Grant Merwitz: So they have a little eyes on everyone.

163
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.339
Grant Merwitz: So that's all, so he processes those studies.

164
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:18.740
Grant Merwitz: Inora has the software that processes the pay slips, and she gives it back to me. So I give her the leave and the payroll after leaving the overtime, and any changes, and any amounts.

165
00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:35.580
Grant Merwitz: So I have a staff file where I have everybody listed with their contracts and things. So, data supplies info and, NORA. Process Payments. Which works fine, but… And that's P-A-Y-E-T, got it? They pay the… yes, they submit the PAYE?

166
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.590
Grant Merwitz: I always check it, I check these things before I give it the go-ahead to submit. Do you release them?

167
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.050
Grant Merwitz: So James is the only one who can release.

168
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:52.630
Grant Merwitz: SARS payments. Yes, but I do need to remind them.

169
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.979
Grant Merwitz: Okay, let's just talk bank accounts, so bank accounts we have… is it the Investec?

170
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:10.900
Grant Merwitz: Yes, we have Investigate for Saint of Val, and for the Inc. as well. Same one? No. They have same bank account. No, no, no. They're both with Investig.

171
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.870
Grant Merwitz: I need James, can I release. Socks. Socks.

172
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.050
Grant Merwitz: You can't dedicate thoroughly.

173
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.270
Grant Merwitz: It's not…

174
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:30.210
Grant Merwitz: No, you need to be a level 4 to do that. So it could be a major level 4. I can also then run away and close the account for them to the level 4.

175
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.600
Grant Merwitz: So nobody believed who gave him that.

176
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:52.690
Grant Merwitz: He's… he's fine, as far as he does. I just make sure there's enough money in the account to do what we need. So you've got… your level can see the phone, so you can say releases, you know, so can we just… All other suppliers, I know, and they're seeing releases.

177
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.450
Grant Merwitz: Is that for St. Rafael?

178
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.840
Grant Merwitz: ending.

179
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:05.270
Grant Merwitz: To the same scene have the higher level? Okay, same for some… No, it's the same level, but why… so, if your scene was to load, then I can release.

180
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:12.360
Grant Merwitz: Or if James was to load, then I can release, or, you know, so there's always two people involved in every transaction.

181
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:33.329
Grant Merwitz: Then you do the same thing for his Laporta Inc. Both you and ERC in Canada Reese, Alan.

182
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.290
Grant Merwitz: there's no size there. No, there is size there as well.

183
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.719
Grant Merwitz: again, James releases the… that,

184
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.090
Grant Merwitz: And income tax numbers and so on.

185
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.470
Grant Merwitz: It's going to be loaded for me.

186
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.090
Grant Merwitz: Still not safe, I hope.

187
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.720
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, that's just gonna make you not think of things that aren't you. Financial statements…

188
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.450
Grant Merwitz: So, in order, there's financial statements and income tax.

189
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:24.890
Grant Merwitz: So the reason it's set up like that, and going forward as well, is because if you have an external company in South Africa doing your… you know, the turnovers that we have right now, if you have an external company doing your annual financial statements.

190
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:32.860
Grant Merwitz: then you don't have to be audited. If you don't internally, then you need an auditing company to still go over it, so it's cheaper to do it this way, right?

191
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.719
Grant Merwitz: So that's why an income tax lies for them as well.

192
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:42.520
Grant Merwitz: I already spoke about all the assets must be in St. Rafael,

193
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.059
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, and then just, obviously the bookkeeping for both.

194
00:20:52.190 --> 00:21:03.910
Grant Merwitz: keeping… so just what does bookkeeping mean, if we can just… That's just so… the paperwork, making sure all your supporting documents are loaded onto Xero, to give the Xero processing.

195
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.609
Grant Merwitz: For all three companies, we use Xero. Xero, yeah.

196
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.989
Grant Merwitz: So, all three companies are up to date right now for the whole financial year on Xero, and the supporting documents are on there.

197
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.850
Grant Merwitz: Largely.

198
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.210
Grant Merwitz: Or at least on my drive.

199
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.289
Grant Merwitz: Then under center valve falls the rent.

200
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:33.969
Grant Merwitz: So, also, and the contact person for the landlord. Can we do that for, sector limits as well? Which one? Rent.

201
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:47.440
Grant Merwitz: Christina's been the contact person. I do speak to the agent. I know that Centura Limited, they rent the… oh, so you just don't manage it, but Centura Limited's rent it to Limited, they pay the…

202
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.579
Grant Merwitz: The rental invoice every month.

203
00:21:51.180 --> 00:22:01.100
Grant Merwitz: For UK? UK, the GPE submits the rental invoice to me, and it's one of our suppliers, so I put it under our payments. But I don't manage the contracts.

204
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:08.260
Grant Merwitz: of the rental agreement. So, South Africa and the center of our help, I manage the contracts.

205
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:27.430
Grant Merwitz: for any new leases, or stopping any leases, all those things. Doesn't the Inc. have the lease? The ink… the ink has the niece and their name, but not everything. We've taken on a lot more properties since we started, so the practice is under the Inc.'s name.

206
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.230
Grant Merwitz: Which they won't move, it's too…

207
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:36.159
Grant Merwitz: too tricky. I mean, ideally, we should move it, but we, you know, but this NFL pays for…

208
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.969
Grant Merwitz: It's on the old thing.

209
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:47.600
Grant Merwitz: But Saint Rafael is the… Lesseau… lessee… Of the storage units.

210
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.879
Grant Merwitz: Which we have two, only parking, that one up there, like, the bottom.

211
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.900
Grant Merwitz: Yeah.

212
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.319
Grant Merwitz: And all the parking bays.

213
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:11.900
Grant Merwitz: parking space… So there's maybe 4 or 5 contracts, and then we're taking on this new office down here from the 1st of April, so that must… he's going to send a lease for that as well at some point.

214
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.330
Grant Merwitz: Cool.

215
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:30.420
Grant Merwitz: I mean, we've touched on payroll and everything else, okay, so then other entities would be the trust.

216
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.589
Grant Merwitz: and the TTCs.

217
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.090
Grant Merwitz: Put those together.

218
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.510
Grant Merwitz: Yeah.

219
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:46.129
Grant Merwitz: So… I would… I'll say James personal there, but… Yeah, I'll say James personal.

220
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.880
Grant Merwitz: Atlantic Trust is managing trust.

221
00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:03.479
Grant Merwitz: We are in the process of moving over to Bockelman, but in the meanwhile, and this will probably still be running when I leave.

222
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:12.590
Grant Merwitz: is I instruct the trust on when to pay for James' rent, and school fees, and whatever other things he needs paid.

223
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:21.770
Grant Merwitz: I also… Ensure that the two employees that's in the trust are processed, and there's nothing to pay.

224
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.790
Grant Merwitz: Right now, the financial statements align with us to approve

225
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.650
Grant Merwitz: As soon as that's done, we can move the trust over to the new account.

226
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.520
Grant Merwitz: Oppelman, which we haven't really appointed yet.

227
00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:41.670
Grant Merwitz: Ross team.

228
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:54.059
Grant Merwitz: So, Atlantic Trust is not inora, this is another company. Yes. So, in other words, Hokelman could do what Inora are doing, and what Atlantic Trust are doing. That's exactly it.

229
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:11.190
Grant Merwitz: So I could also hand the chat over to, what's her name? Jess at this point. I was thinking to, you know, introduce her to the trust people.

230
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:17.640
Grant Merwitz: With the two employees, Jess and Albus. The two employees is Janine and Albus.

231
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.369
Grant Merwitz: Cool. And then the TTC is owned by Janine.

232
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:38.439
Grant Merwitz: What we do, you know, Inora does the… The… income tax.

233
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.130
Grant Merwitz: Which is coming up.

234
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.599
Grant Merwitz: And of course, if there's anything due.

235
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.639
Grant Merwitz: JS pays for the income tax, because it's…

236
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:52.870
Grant Merwitz: Even though the company is in Janine's name, still, you know… It sucks.

237
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.940
Grant Merwitz: Have a chance to cover a lot of years, I mean… Don't miss home.

238
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:04.160
Grant Merwitz: Income of. It's really little sometimes it's like 5 grand, 60 grand.

239
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:16.390
Grant Merwitz: But it just needs to be done, so this is why I'm putting it on there. This is another one of those that's on the calendar. So after this, we can say, okay, what are the submissions, what time of the year? So we can just make sure we don't miss any of those.

240
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:22.239
Grant Merwitz: Okay. And that support industries, you know.

241
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:30.560
Grant Merwitz: the Port Industries, I just do the, annual returns and the beneficial ownership, ultimate beneficial ownership, which I'm doing now.

242
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.670
Grant Merwitz: So… It'll be good for another year.

243
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.870
Grant Merwitz: But we mustn't forget about the border industries, because Enough.

244
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:52.870
Grant Merwitz: UBO, ultimate beneficial. Sorry. Or is that manual thing you have to do? Yeah. So, they do it all over the world.

245
00:26:53.220 --> 00:27:01.430
Grant Merwitz: South Africa only adopted it a couple of years ago, that basically, every year, any director of a company needs to let

246
00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:08.640
Grant Merwitz: SIPs and SARs and the whole futility know which other interests they have in other businesses.

247
00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:14.020
Grant Merwitz: So that they can just keep oversight that you are, in fact, you know…

248
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:32.079
Grant Merwitz: just where do you have your finger in the pie, so that they can make sure that you're really declaring all your income, and you're really doing everything above board, and you don't have, like, any hidden companies that they don't know of. So they, if you don't submit the UBO, then they deregister the company.

249
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.399
Grant Merwitz: And then you said, doing that now.

250
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.439
Grant Merwitz: In general, for the ink, for the ink, and so on.

251
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.419
Grant Merwitz: Okay, so can we just say UBO done for the ink? Can we route that up there?

252
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.030
Grant Merwitz: blah, blah, I don't think I said that we're doing it.

253
00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.209
Grant Merwitz: We do do that, huh? Yeah. He does annual EVO, you know.

254
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.780
Grant Merwitz: What about St. Rafael?

255
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.659
Grant Merwitz: That's only due, I think… But you do have a few minutes to respond to put it to you about a day.

256
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:17.949
Grant Merwitz: So, a company that can take it over is called Imperium Registrations, Theo, he's got our cycles, you know, since he…

257
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.209
Grant Merwitz: You can also take care of all the secretarial work.

258
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.500
Grant Merwitz: As we can call it, so any name change abilities that we need.

259
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.189
Grant Merwitz: Anything's been provided up?

260
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:35.269
Grant Merwitz: It's the name of the company? Imperium Registrations, and his name is Field.

261
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.949
Grant Merwitz: Ethereum registrations. Yeah. Awful.

262
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:52.569
Grant Merwitz: Okay, cool. So we were down to DBC, and according industries that you just do the annual returns year.

263
00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:02.769
Grant Merwitz: Okay, we had a topic of financial reporting, which was… Mark down here. Yeah. So…

264
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:11.010
Grant Merwitz: A big one that we need to now discuss is the, you know, the…

265
00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.469
Grant Merwitz: forecast for next year, which must be done in fair.

266
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.980
Grant Merwitz: here, huh?

267
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.030
Grant Merwitz: And then weekly KPIs and monthly financial reporting.

268
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.779
Grant Merwitz: To the board. To the board.

269
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.010
Grant Merwitz: To me, he had the answer, both, I believe.

270
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.380
Grant Merwitz: Good time.

271
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.480
Grant Merwitz: Got it.

272
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.640
Grant Merwitz: I think the monthly reporting space in management counts.

273
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.890
Grant Merwitz: So that's the… you've already said monthly financial reporting, that's the management of ours.

274
00:29:53.190 --> 00:30:00.059
Grant Merwitz: I mean, that's a little thing on its own. We could expand on, but it's not necessary. The fact is already there to look at.

275
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.050
Grant Merwitz: Then, of course, there's… the…

276
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:22.320
Grant Merwitz: We already touched on, like, the reporting to SARS, your VAT, and your PVE, and all that stuff. That's already up to date. There's only maybe something to keep on top of is the workman's comp.

277
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:28.220
Grant Merwitz: That return is coming in, but I think we can put that in the calendar, you know, June the two set under.

278
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.570
Grant Merwitz: That's only central foul, because it's…

279
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.890
Grant Merwitz: It doesn't have… Because Sedra for old, we have bookkeeping. I've got bookkeeping and not ready.
