# Sanctura Invoicing Model - Summary Overview

## The Change

Sanctura is moving from **retrospective billing** (invoice after service) to **real-time, upfront-aligned billing**. This eliminates revenue leakage, reduces admin burden, and improves patient clarity.

---

## Core Model: Packages + Real-Time Invoicing + Optional Deposits

### How It Works

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-Time Invoicing** | Services invoiced at time of delivery (same day) |
| **Payment on the Day** | Default expectation for consultations, supplements, treatments |
| **Packages** | Discounted upfront bundles (15-20% off) for hyperthermia, HBOT, protocols |
| **Optional Deposits** | Patient-elected prepayment for fewer payment touchpoints |
| **High-Cost Prepayment** | Items above threshold (e.g. genetic panels) paid before ordering |

## Payment Rules at a Glance

| Service Type | Payment Timing |
|-------------|----------------|
| Consultations | On the day |
| Supplements | On the day |
| IV Infusions | On the day |
| Hyperthermia / HBOT | Package (upfront) or on the day |
| High-cost tests/medications | Before ordering |

---

## Packages - Key Points

- Paid upfront, creates a credit balance
- 15-20% discount applied
- Credit used against intended treatments
- Supplements/consultations should be paid separately to preserve package value

---

## Cancellation Policy

| Notice Given | Charge |
|--------------|--------|
| Less than 24 hours | 50% |
| Less than 1 hour / no-show | 100% |
| Clinical discretion | Waived for genuine medical emergencies |

**Note:** No charge for unused/unmixed medications or consumables.

---

## Medical Aid

- Sanctura does **not** bill medical aid directly
- Patients pay Sanctura, then reclaim independently
- Sanctura provides compliant invoices and support documentation

---

## Why This Matters

- **Financial sustainability** - predictable cash flow, no chasing payments
- **Operational clarity** - everyone knows the rules
- **Patient trust** - transparent, no surprise bills
- **Clinical autonomy** - discretion preserved for genuine circumstances
