00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.109
Grant Merwitz: Okay, one way, anyways, there was a conversation between Sam and Linda earlier on about…

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:26.109
Grant Merwitz: You know, what the different areas of work are, what it entails, as far as possible frequencies and those sorts of things, as much as could be achieved in such a short period of time. Now we've got a breakdown of the different work, the different work areas, what it entails, those frequencies, and all of those things as the,

3
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.999
Grant Merwitz: Yes, Claude has set it up for us. And Claude has allocated certain tasks to about 5 or 6 stakeholders, including an order.

4
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Grant Merwitz: those of us who are internal to… And I think it was elaborate a little bit. We don't necessarily have, like, 30% of all those time, so we've got to be clear about who has… who has the amount of time that we could take advantage of. Exactly. So I think we need to do a brief review and make sure that makes sense, it's logical.

5
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.189
Grant Merwitz: And then each stakeholder needs to be engaged. Obviously, the way we engage internally and the way we engage in order is different, you know?

6
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.309
Grant Merwitz: And then to say, okay, well, listen, this is the proposal, and assuming that we align to the proposal.

7
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:18.989
Grant Merwitz: and, you know, we've got four weeks. What… and each party needs to define what they need to do within that 4 weeks. Now, you and I can just speak directly to what Ben said about internal… our own internal, sort of discussions around on the process.

8
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:31.669
Grant Merwitz: But for the external people, like… and I call Kinari and Ricardo external, because we're not physically in Cape Town, and of course, in order, we're going to need to have a little bit more work involved with them, like, in order, as soon as possible, we meet, we say, look, this is a change.

9
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.179
Grant Merwitz: This is the thinking, but while we're recruiting the OCFO or another bookkeeper, and or another accountant, whatever that looks like.

10
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.680
Grant Merwitz: We need to have a functional sort of plan in place between us and them.

11
00:01:43.820 --> 00:02:00.709
Grant Merwitz: They will need to let us know for the next 3 to 6 months, I'm not saying it'll take that long, but for the next 3 to 6 months, what they will need from us, you know? And we will need to make sure that we know where now to find that information from our, you know, I should say, you know, that sort of thing. And then, of course, with,

12
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.520
Grant Merwitz: Same conversation of similar to Ginadi and Ricardo.

13
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:16.199
Grant Merwitz: And then, of course, I'm showing that over the… in the next couple of days, tomorrow I'll meet with the CFO candidates, or the Council CFO candidates, and we'll see if there's anything there.

14
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.829
Grant Merwitz: and understand from them what role they can play within this, you know? Maybe get their thoughts on it, because the CFO is C-level, as it says, you know, they're going to be as…

15
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:37.920
Grant Merwitz: operational as you and I are, partially because we here, and this is the only company we service, that with multiple clients, that's the model, you know. Okay, let's just correct something with OCFO, because the name…

16
00:02:38.780 --> 00:03:02.819
Grant Merwitz: isn't exactly what they do, they're a consultancy. So they could give you a fractional CFO as a service, but they could also give you a bookkeeper. You know, so they're more like a consultancy that can maybe give us resources we need. It's not just a CFO. However, they can give us a fractional CFO as well. So it's, you know, they're a service provider, and not just a CFO there.

17
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.720
Grant Merwitz: us.

18
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.569
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, I mean, I think we do need to also, and perhaps it's going to be through them, or through OptiWorks with another agency.

19
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:26.249
Grant Merwitz: times of power and times at least getting another bookkeeper. I mean, I know that it might not happen, I know that lots of effort have gone into it, it's important to find the right candidate, and that's all important, it's a critical role. But if we can get someone

20
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.200
Grant Merwitz: Maybe.

21
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:52.159
Grant Merwitz: a week or two with Alida before she leaves, that'll also be used. I know it's, like, senior level, but it will keep the operations, like, the daily… because that stuff can build up quickly, capturing the daily invoices, making… allocating payments, and generating invoices, or whatever. So that person would be sitting there sort of helping us day-to-day operations, so we can focus on bigger level, you know, management accounts, and maintenance, and forecasts, and those things, which take a lot more time.

22
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.430
Grant Merwitz: It could.

23
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.639
Grant Merwitz: But I do have quite a low…

24
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.549
Grant Merwitz: I don't have much confidence in Optirics, because…

25
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.950
Grant Merwitz: They are our HR partner, but they're a…

26
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:22.029
Grant Merwitz: generous to the critical agency, I don't think if we… given how long it's taken us to place a bookkeeper, first of all, is why I have no confidence. Yeah. But now we've got this time crunch, it's like, we need someone who can find us a bookkeeper tomorrow. Yeah. So I'd much rather lean on a…

27
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:37.640
Grant Merwitz: accounting, you know, focused consultancy or recruitment company. Sure. It probably has these people sitting available. A bank of people, yeah. And perhaps it's more of a contractor who can start immediately, comes in in a permanent placement, because…

28
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:58.750
Grant Merwitz: 3 months, 6 months, or whatever the case may be. Yeah, let's just get someone in who can start doing the day-to-day. I think the additional element of the risk on this, of course, is working with money, you know? But we assume these guys would have screened them appropriately in any case. So, it's a good point. I think when it just comes to releasing payments.

29
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.440
Grant Merwitz: that's where we want a control point. Yeah, this is where I am at the moment. Yeah, so I think,

30
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:24.659
Grant Merwitz: you know, me and you, probably going to have to fill that gap to someone of that level of a financial benefit, or a small senior level comes in, who can be accountable enough to release payments. The bookkeeper could just instruct the payments that would come, you know, and this whole, like, catch and release,

31
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:42.010
Grant Merwitz: process where, let's say they ask me, I'll load the payment, you'll release it, and vice versa. So there isn't one person who's got that… No, no, they have to have those controls in place, though, even though it's going to be us. We have to have the controls. But that's fine, that's pretty… Yeah.

32
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.360
Grant Merwitz: It's the same thing for setting, yeah, it's just…

33
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.849
Grant Merwitz: segregation, security. Just on the plan.

34
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.279
Grant Merwitz: Look, I do want to just…

35
00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:03.460
Grant Merwitz: query Claude a little bit with the plan, you know, but it's kind of proposed this Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, where Phase 1's about documenting and,

36
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:18.490
Grant Merwitz: knowledge base, and Phase 2, after a leader moves, seems to be an operational handover. We're gonna need a… one of the leaders on the side of operational handover as much as possible, so that we can ensure that we've got it in hand. I don't… I don't want to have…

37
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.820
Grant Merwitz: Just information being gathered for romance.

38
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:32.259
Grant Merwitz: And then the SME kind of leaves, and then we're stuck. So, I would say there's probably this week, followed by

39
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:44.349
Grant Merwitz: operational handovers happening from next week, as far as 30 minutes getting involved. Yeah. So I would ask to run the, operational handover work.

40
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.300
Grant Merwitz: Concurrently with, what was that first step?

41
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:58.800
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, so it's these three. Yeah, so I'm going on Phase 2 concurrently with Phase 1, in a manner of…

42
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:10.349
Grant Merwitz: the last, operation is… that makes sense operationally. So I would give it maybe this one, then once the time that it starts to just…

43
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.139
Grant Merwitz: get through the complexity of this problem.

44
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.779
Grant Merwitz: Everything that's happening.

45
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.940
Grant Merwitz: Whoa, we bought the name of God.

46
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.790
Grant Merwitz: Yeah.

47
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:41.669
Grant Merwitz: So, before the end of this week, all the stakeholders need to engage, and they have a copy of their proposed duties, and we can obviously extract it from there to say, yeah. So, I think artifacts I want to get next, you know, so I want to get the plan.

48
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.249
Grant Merwitz: For the duration, which is duration of the notice period plus

49
00:07:46.300 --> 00:08:02.529
Grant Merwitz: the weeks afterwards to just, keep on going. I want to get her to stop responsibilities and who we believe is going to be fulfilling those. There is already an attempt at that, but I think I want to… I want to work with Claude to show it to us, and get it feedback, and show it to us, and give it feedback.

50
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:11.249
Grant Merwitz: So we can have a vast plan, we can have a vast list of responsibilities, who we believe would handle them. Yeah. And then the third artifact would be

51
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:19.220
Grant Merwitz: But they passed must have access to GATE, access to SARS, p-file, access to…

52
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:33.499
Grant Merwitz: this supplier's portal, have access to this bank account, get the details, contact people, so there's a bunch of information, base renewables of management of accounts and suppliers, and…

53
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.710
Grant Merwitz: group, and service providers.

54
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:55.859
Grant Merwitz: after those three artifacts, then we can talk about, okay, so we need to meet with an order to discuss this, let's plan, let's, you know, you'll meet with an order to discuss this, and I'll meet with… I'll need to discuss that, some of that, you know, we'll just… Let's also add that billing and the invoicing exercise in there, right?

55
00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.090
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, so we have the…

56
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.110
Grant Merwitz: The kind of three-phrase approach, as it was originally called.

57
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:20.200
Grant Merwitz: But the rollout of invoicing needs to be part of this plan. Yes. On the one hand, we're getting information from the leader, on the other hand, the operational responsibilities are being handed over while she's here, but on the other hand, we've got to change the invoice process

58
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:27.460
Grant Merwitz: And, and roll that out. Because when it comes to one of the big problems we have, which is debt collecting and chasing,

59
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:37.620
Grant Merwitz: chasing the money, the invoice proposal deviates that somewhat. It gets us on the front foot of debt collection.

60
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.599
Grant Merwitz: makes the problem not get worse while we're trying to solve it, because Adido has mentioned

61
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.139
Grant Merwitz: Debt collections, very time-consuming from home, difficult.

62
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.210
Grant Merwitz: But for the billing and that, we're going to do that in Zero VAT.

63
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:00.640
Grant Merwitz: Yeah, and part of this, I think, moving the accounting process over is getting a soft bridge onto zero.

64
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:16.169
Grant Merwitz: And then, of course, part of that would be making sure you have enough license or access for people, and there would be an element of training as well on the Xero end. So I did provide a plan for Xero, and, you know, with something high level longer, I want to apply.

65
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.470
Grant Merwitz: Defining the way it's gonna work.

66
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.700
Grant Merwitz: then…

67
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:32.520
Grant Merwitz: testing it amongst those who already know how to use Xero as a proof of concept, then educating the business about this is going to happen, then letting them do a dry run that isn't real

68
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:42.769
Grant Merwitz: And then, you know, that's the training, and then the actual, you know, drills, run a drill, like, patient came in, they did this and this, make an invoice. You know, let them…

69
00:10:42.980 --> 00:11:00.129
Grant Merwitz: drift, and then go live. And it's like, okay, so now process has been it down, we've tested it, we've educated, they've had some experience doing it, now we're in a position to go live. That was the part of the plan, that I was going to sit with the leader and

70
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.569
Grant Merwitz: And, and start today.

71
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:11.609
Grant Merwitz: There was a bit of, like, a billing manual, I guess, as a training, I mean, for lack of a better word, but also our colleagues to know, this is how we do.

72
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:18.249
Grant Merwitz: Tariffs, this is how we do stock, this is, you know, when we do different tariffs, and all of those sorts of things.

73
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.200
Grant Merwitz: There's principles, and then there's obviously,

74
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:32.620
Grant Merwitz: the nuances, the Barco, that sort of things. Yeah, so it's going to be like this tall order to try to handle and change the system, but…

75
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:39.050
Grant Merwitz: I don't want to be in a position where we're handing over to one other individual who does everything.

76
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:45.579
Grant Merwitz: I mean, in a perfect world, for this next 4 weeks, Anita's not doing work, she's just doing endo.

77
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.290
Grant Merwitz: Yeah. You know?

78
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:55.549
Grant Merwitz: Whether that's spending an hour at me in the morning, hours in the afternoon, two hours at the city, changing in the newer to build a…

79
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.210
Grant Merwitz: The consultations a little… and the,

80
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.809
Grant Merwitz: Supplements, and then spending a few hours with the nurses, and retaining them on those sorts of things, or whatever, you know?

81
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:12.840
Grant Merwitz: Doing an afternoon session where these are all the, you know, the accounts and the profiles, and this is, you know, the context and all of those things, so…

82
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.850
Grant Merwitz: You're on the left, depending on how to hold down.

83
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.210
Grant Merwitz: Gonna take a lot of just,

84
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:28.750
Grant Merwitz: focus on education. That's why I want to get it down to, like, a formal plan that we just follow.

85
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.989
Grant Merwitz: I think that one of the.
