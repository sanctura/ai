# Invoicing Rollout Integration

## Overview

The invoicing transformation is not separate from the transition - it's a core workstream that **must happen** during the transition because:

1. **Reduces dependency** - Shifts invoicing from central finance person to point-of-service
2. **Addresses debt collection** - Real-time invoicing prevents the problem getting worse
3. **Alida's knowledge** - She needs to be involved in defining and training

## Detailed Week-by-Week: Invoicing Rollout

### Week 1: Define & Prepare (26 Jan - 1 Feb)

| Day | Invoicing Activity | Owner | Output |

---

### Week 4: Dry Run & Go-Live (17-23 Feb)

| Day | Invoicing Activity | Owner | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|-------|
| Mon 17 | Dry run day 1 - supervised invoicing | Kyle + Alida | Alida reviews all |
| Tue 18 | Dry run day 2 - continue | Kyle + Alida | Fix issues |
| Wed 19 | Dry run day 3 - reduced supervision | Kyle | Alida available |
| Thu 20 | **Go-live decision meeting** | Grant + Kyle | Ready or not? |
| Fri 21 | **Go-live (if ready)** OR continue dry run | All | |
| Sat-Sun | Alida available for questions | Alida | Weekend support |
| Mon 23 | Final troubleshooting, Alida last day | All | Handover complete |

**Go-Live Criteria:**
- [ ] All staff can create invoices independently
- [ ] All staff know which services they invoice
- [ ] Reception can print patient statements
- [ ] Reception can record payments
- [ ] Package credits understood
- [ ] No critical errors in dry run
- [ ] Billing manual complete and distributed

---

## Phase 3: Post-Departure (24 Feb onwards)

### CPT Stabilisation (Weeks 5-8)

| Week | Focus | Owner |
|------|-------|-------|
| Week 5 (24-28 Feb) | Daily invoice review, catch errors | Kyle + OCFO |
| Week 6 (3-7 Mar) | Reduce to twice-daily review | Kyle |
| Week 7 (10-14 Mar) | Weekly audit only | OCFO |
| Week 8 (17-21 Mar) | Process stable, document lessons | OCFO |

**Success Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Invoices same-day | 100% | Audit |
| Errors requiring correction | < 5% | Weekly count |
| Staff confidence | High | Feedback |
| Patient complaints | Minimal | Track |

### UK Rollout (April onwards)

| Phase | Activity | Duration | Owner |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| Lessons documented | Capture what worked/didn't from CPT | 1 week | OCFO |
| UK adaptation | Adjust process for UK context | 1 week | Amanda + OCFO |
| UK training | Train UK reception (smaller team) | 1 week | Amanda |
| UK dry run | Supervised invoicing | 1 week | Amanda |
| UK go-live | Live invoicing | - | Amanda |

**Note:** UK rollout is simpler because:
- Xero already deployed
- Smaller operation
- Lessons learned from CPT

---

## Roles in Invoicing Rollout

| Role | Invoicing Responsibility |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Alida** | Define process, create billing manual, train all staff (Weeks 1-4) |
| **Kyle** | Invoicing rollout lead (CPT), supervise dry run, ongoing oversight |
| **Amanda** | Invoicing rollout lead (UK), apply lessons from CPT |
| **Grant** | Go-live decision, escalation point |
| **OCFO** | Post-go-live audit, quality control, support Kyle |
| **Nurses** | Invoice treatments, IV, medications at point of delivery |
| **Reception** | Invoice consultations, supplements, collect payments |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Staff resist change | Adoption fails | Clear communication on "why", involve early |
| Xero not ready | Can't train | Confirm setup Week 1 |
| Training insufficient | Errors post go-live | Extended dry run, OCFO audit |
| Alida leaves before go-live | No expert support | Front-load training, complete by Week 3 |
| Nurses too busy to invoice | Missed charges | Simplify process, mobile/tablet access |

---

## Decision: Go-Live Timing

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Go-live Week 4 (with Alida)** | Expert available for issues | Compressed timeline |
| **B: Go-live Week 5 (after Alida)** | More training time | No expert if issues |
| **C: Soft launch Week 4, full Week 5** | Best of both | More complex |

**Recommendation:** Option A or C - Maximise Alida's involvement. Even a soft launch (e.g., just consultations) while she's here is better than waiting.

---

## Integration Summary

The invoicing rollout is **not optional** - it's essential to the transition because:

1. **Without it:** Whoever replaces Alida inherits the same central invoicing burden
2. **With it:** Invoicing is distributed, new person focuses on oversight not data entry
3. **Timing:** Must happen while Alida is here to define process and train staff

The three phases become:

| Phase | Transition Focus | Invoicing Focus |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1+2** | Handover + operate | Define, train, dry run, go-live |
| **Phase 3** | Stabilise, hire permanent | Stabilise CPT, rollout UK |
