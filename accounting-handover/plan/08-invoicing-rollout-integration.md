# Invoicing Rollout Integration

## Overview

The invoicing transformation is not separate from the transition - it's a core workstream that **must happen** during the transition because:

1. **Reduces dependency** - Shifts invoicing from central finance person to point-of-service
2. **Addresses debt collection** - Real-time invoicing prevents the problem getting worse
3. **Alida's knowledge** - She needs to be involved in defining and training

---

## Rollout Structure

| Role | Person | Location |
|------|--------|----------|
| Process Owner | Alida | Builds everything Week 1, leads training Week 2 |
| Rollout Lead | Kyle | Cape Town - runs team from go-live onwards |
| Rollout Lead | Amanda | UK - runs team from go-live onwards |

**Simultaneous rollout:** Both Cape Town and UK go live together at end of Week 2.

---

## Critical Timeline

**Goal:** Go live with invoicing by end of Week 2, giving us **2 full weeks of live operation** with Alida available for support before she leaves.

## Why This Approach

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Go-live Week 4 | Go-live end of Week 2 |
| 0 weeks live with Alida support | **2 weeks live with Alida support** |
| Issues discovered after she leaves | Issues discovered while she can help |
| Alida doing invoicing until last day | Alida freed up for other handover |

---

### Week 2: Training & GO LIVE (3-7 Feb)

**Alida leads training, Kyle & Amanda support their teams - GO LIVE Friday**

| Day | Invoicing Activity | Owner | Output |
|-----|-------------------|-------|--------|
| **Mon 3** | Reception training: Xero basics, consultations | Alida leads, Kyle + Amanda support | Reception on Xero |
| | Billing manual finalized | Alida | Manual complete |
| **Tue 4** | Reception training: supplements, payments | Alida leads, Kyle + Amanda support | Reception trained |

| | Practice invoices - all staff | Kyle + Amanda supervise | Test invoices |
| **Thu 6** | **Full dry run - all staff, real scenarios** | Kyle + Amanda lead, Alida supports | Issues identified |
| | Fix any critical issues | Alida + Kyle + Amanda | Issues resolved |
| **Fri 7** | **GO-LIVE DECISION** (morning) | Grant + Kyle + Amanda | Decision made |
| | **GO LIVE** (if ready) | All staff (CPT + UK) | First real invoices |

**Go-Live Criteria (must meet by Thu 6):**

---

### Week 3: LIVE - Kyle & Amanda Run Teams (10-14 Feb)

**Kyle & Amanda run their teams independently. Alida troubleshoots and handles exceptions only.**

| Day | Invoicing | Kyle & Amanda | Alida's Role |
|-----|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Mon 10** | Live invoicing Day 3 | Run teams, morning check-in with Alida | Available for questions |
| **Tue 11** | Live invoicing Day 4 | Run teams, review invoices | Spot-check, troubleshoot |
| **Wed 12** | Live invoicing Day 5 | Run teams, handle staff questions | Troubleshoot patterns |
| **Thu 13** | Live invoicing Day 6 | Run teams, refine processes | Update manual if needed |
| **Fri 14** | Live invoicing Day 7 | Week review with Alida | Week 1 review, other handover |

**Alida's Time Split Week 3:**
- ~30% Invoicing support (questions, troubleshooting)
- ~70% Other handover activities

**Kyle & Amanda's Role:** Primary invoicing oversight for their teams, escalate to Alida only when stuck

---

### Week 4: LIVE - Kyle & Amanda Fully Independent (17-23 Feb)

**Teams fully independent. Alida available for edge cases only.**

| Day | Invoicing | Kyle & Amanda | Alida's Role |
|-----|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Mon 17** | Live invoicing Day 8 | Run teams fully independent | Available if needed |
| **Tue 18** | Live invoicing Day 9 | Run teams fully independent | Available if needed |
| **Wed 19** | Live invoicing Day 10 | Week 2 review with Alida | Final documentation |
| **Thu 20** | Live invoicing Day 11 | Run teams, document lessons | Edge case support only |
| **Fri 21** | Live invoicing Day 12 | Run teams, final Q&A | Stock count support |
| **Sat-Mon** | Live invoicing continues | Fully independent | **ALIDA'S LAST DAY: 23 Feb** |

**Alida's Time Split Week 4:**
- ~10% Invoicing (edge cases only)
- ~90% Other handover and final items

**By End of Week 4:**
- 12+ days of live invoicing completed
- Kyle & Amanda fully confident running their teams
- All issues encountered while Alida could help
- Process proven before she leaves

---

## Phase 3: Post-Departure (24 Feb onwards)

### Continuation (Weeks 5-8)

By the time Alida leaves, both CPT and UK have been live for **2+ weeks**. The hard part is done.

| Week | Focus | Owner | Invoicing Status |
|------|-------|-------|------------------|
| Week 5 (24-28 Feb) | Continue operations, catch any issues | Kyle + Amanda + OCFO | Day 13-17 |
| Week 6 (3-7 Mar) | Reduce oversight to twice-daily review | Kyle + Amanda | Day 18-22 |
| Week 7 (10-14 Mar) | Weekly audit only | OCFO | Stable |
| Week 8 (17-21 Mar) | Document lessons learned | OCFO + Kyle + Amanda | Mature |

**Success Metrics:**
| Metric | Target | Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Invoices same-day | 100% | Audit |
| Errors requiring correction | < 5% | Weekly count |
| Staff confidence | High | Feedback |
| Patient complaints | Minimal | Track |

### Ongoing Support Structure

| Location | Lead | Escalation | Audit |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| Cape Town | Kyle | Grant | OCFO |
| UK | Amanda | Grant | OCFO |

**Note:** Both locations went live simultaneously, so lessons learned and process refinements can be shared between Kyle and Amanda throughout.

## Roles in Invoicing Rollout

| Role | Invoicing Responsibility |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Alida** | Week 1: Build foundation (Xero, manual, process). Week 2: Lead training. Weeks 3-4: Support only |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Staff resist change | Adoption fails | Clear communication on "why", involve early |
| Xero not ready | Can't train | Confirm setup Week 1 |
| Training insufficient | Errors post go-live | Extended dry run, OCFO audit |
| Alida leaves before go-live | No expert support | Front-load training, complete by Week 3 |
| Nurses too busy to invoice | Missed charges | Simplify process, mobile/tablet access |

---

## Decision: Go-Live Timing

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Go-live Week 4 (with Alida)** | Expert available for issues | Compressed timeline |
| **B: Go-live Week 5 (after Alida)** | More training time | No expert if issues |
| **C: Soft launch Week 4, full Week 5** | Best of both | More complex |

**Recommendation:** Option A or C - Maximise Alida's involvement. Even a soft launch (e.g., just consultations) while she's here is better than waiting.

## Why This is Better

| Metric | Old Plan | New Plan |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Days live before Alida leaves | 2-3 days | **12+ days** |
| Time with expert support | Minimal | **2 full weeks** |
| Issues discovered post-departure | Many | Minimal |
| Alida time for other handover | Limited | **Weeks 3-4 freed up** |

## The Trade-Off

**Week 1-2 is a tall ask:**
- Xero configuration in 2 days
- All staff trained in 5-6 days
- Go-live by end of Week 2

**But the payoff is worth it:**
- 2 weeks of live operation with safety net
- All issues hit while Alida can help
- Team confident before she leaves
- Process proven, not theoretical
