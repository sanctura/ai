# Invoicing Responsibilities - Rollout Summary

## Overview

This document summarises the invoicing transformation rollout plan. The goal is to shift invoicing from a centralised finance function to point-of-service, with nurses and reception creating invoices in real-time.

**Key Principle:** Cape Town and UK go live **simultaneously** at end of Week 2.

## Decentralized Invoicing Model

**Key principle:** Invoicing happens at point of service, not centrally by finance.

| Role | Invoices | Responsibility |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Nurses** | IVs, treatments, medications | Invoice at point of delivery |
| **Reception** | Consultations, supplements | Invoice and collect payment |
| **Reception** | Patient statement | Print at patient exit |
| **Kyle / Amanda** | Process ownership | Governance, training, compliance - *not execution* |

### Who Invoices What (Post Go-Live)

| Who | What They Invoice | System |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| **Reception** | Consultations, supplements, payments received, patient statements | Xero |
| **Nurses** | Treatments, IV therapy, medications | Xero |
| **Kyle** | Governance, training, compliance (CPT) - *not execution* | Xero |
| **Amanda** | Governance, training, compliance (UK) - *not execution* | Xero |
| **OCFO** | Weekly audit, quality control | Xero |

## Post-Departure: Continuation (24 Feb onwards)

### Three-Phase Billing Evolution

| Phase | Focus | Timing |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Survival/Simplify** | Basic codes, laminated checklist, invoices presentable for medical aid | Go-live → stable (CURRENT FOCUS) |
| **Phase 2: Optimise** | Improve pricing, reduce missed charges, refine processes, add audit rules | Post-departure |
| **Phase 3: Interface/Automation** | CRM integration, Xero API/marketplace apps | Future |

**Current Focus:** Phase 1 is the priority during transition. Get invoicing working reliably before optimizing.

### Future Improvement: Billing Baskets

*Not on critical path for go-live - defer to Phase 2*

- Baskets/bundles for common billing scenarios (e.g., infusion bundle) as future optimization
- Must accommodate stock tracking requirements
- Avoid confusion with existing advance-purchase bundles (different concept)

### Continuation Timeline

| Week | Focus | Owner | Invoicing Status |
|------|-------|-------|------------------|
| Week 5 (24-28 Feb) | Continue operations, catch any issues | Kyle + Amanda + OCFO | Day 13-17 |
| Week 6 (3-7 Mar) | Reduce oversight to twice-daily review | Kyle + Amanda | Day 18-22 |
| Week 7 (10-14 Mar) | Weekly audit only | OCFO | Stable |
| Week 8 (17-21 Mar) | Document lessons learned | OCFO + Kyle + Amanda | Mature |

**Ongoing Support Structure:**

| Location | Lead | Escalation | Audit |
|----------|------|------------|-------|
| Cape Town | Kyle | Grant | OCFO |
| UK | Amanda | Grant | OCFO |

## Success Metrics

|--------|--------|---------|
| Invoices same-day | 100% | Audit |
| Errors requiring correction | < 5% | Weekly count |

## Risks & Mitigations
