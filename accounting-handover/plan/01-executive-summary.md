# Financial Manager Transition Plan - Executive Summary

## Situation

Alida Wiese, Financial Manager, has resigned effective 23 February 2026. She manages financial operations across 7 entities in UK and South Africa, with approximately 4 weeks for handover.

## Strategic Approach

### Three-Phase Transition (Phases 1 & 2 Run Concurrently)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE 1 + 2: HANDOVER & OPERATE    │        PHASE 3: TRANSFORM            │
│  (26 Jan - 23 Feb)                  │        (24 Feb onwards)              │
│  ═══════════════════════════════════│════════════════════════════════════  │
│  Week 1: Mobilise                   │                                      │
│  ► Engage all stakeholders          │  ► Bookkeeper/OCFO operational       │
│  ► Begin documentation              │  ► Permanent hire recruited          │
│  ► OCFO/bookkeeper search           │  ► Invoicing rollout continues       │
│                                     │  ► New steady state                  │
│  Weeks 2-4: Concurrent Handover     │                                      │
│  ► Operational shadowing (live)     │                                      │
│  ► Invoicing rollout begins         │                                      │
│  ► Alida focuses on training        │                                      │
│  ► Bookkeeper onboards (if found)   │                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Change:** Invoicing goes LIVE end of Week 2 (CPT + UK simultaneously), giving 2 full weeks of operation with Alida as support before she leaves. Kyle leads CPT rollout, Amanda leads UK rollout.

## Key Decisions Required

| Decision | Recommendation | Owner | By When |
|----------|---------------|-------|---------|
| Engage OCFO/bookkeeper | Yes - use OCFO or accounting-focused agency (not Optiworx) | Grant | Week 1 |
| OCFO scope | Bookkeeping, reporting, cash flow, invoicing project support | Grant | Week 1 |
| Bookkeeper placement | Urgent - ideally overlap with Alida for 1-2 weeks (contractor OK) | Grant | Week 1-2 |
| Invoicing rollout | Yes - begin immediately, addresses debt collection issue | Grant | Week 1 |
| Inaura engagement | Meet ASAP to clarify their role for next 3-6 months | Grant/Yaseen | Week 1 |

**Note on OCFO:** OCFO is a consultancy that can provide various services - fractional CFO, bookkeeper, or other resources. Not just a CFO service.

## Resource Allocation

### Alida's Focus (Notice Period)

**Ideal state:** Alida focuses entirely on handover, not BAU work. Her time should be spent:
- Training nurses and reception on invoicing
- Shadowing sessions with OCFO/bookkeeper/Yaseen
- Documenting processes and transferring knowledge
- Introducing successors to service providers

### Internal Team

| Person | Transition Role | Time Commitment |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Grant | Transition lead, OCFO management, external engagement | High |
| Yaseen | Banking operations, payment release (dual control) | +20% |
| Ricardo | Financial oversight (note: based remotely, not in CPT) | +30% |
| Kyle | SA practice coordination, **invoicing rollout lead (CPT)** | Moderate |
| Amanda | UK practice coordination, **invoicing rollout lead (UK)** | Moderate |
| James | SARS releases, approvals only | Minimal additional |

**Payment Controls:** Bookkeeper loads payments → Grant or Yaseen releases. Dual control maintained.

### External Support

| Provider | Role | Engage By |
|----------|------|-----------|
| OCFO (consultancy) | Fractional CFO and/or bookkeeper services | Week 1 |
| Bookkeeper (via OCFO or accounting agency) | Day-to-day operations - ideally overlap with Alida | Week 2 |
| Inaura | Meet to clarify role for next 3-6 months | Week 1 |
| Kinari | Meet to clarify UK role (Ricardo to engage) | Week 1 |

**Note:** Kinari and Ricardo are "external" in the sense they're not physically in Cape Town - need structured engagement.

## Three Key Artifacts

These are the core deliverables that stakeholders need:

| Artifact | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **1. Transition Plan** | Timeline for notice period + weeks after | This document + detailed plan |
| **2. Responsibility Matrix** | Who handles what, with proposed duties for each stakeholder | [04-responsibility-matrix.md](04-responsibility-matrix.md) |
| **3. Access & Systems Inventory** | SARS eFiling, bank accounts, supplier portals, contacts | [See below](#access--systems-inventory) |

**By end of Week 1:** All stakeholders receive their proposed duties and confirm understanding.

## Critical Path Items

### Must Complete Before 23 February

| Item | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| La Porta Industries UBO & Annual Returns | Alida | In progress |
| February stock count | Alida → Kyle | Planned |
| FY charge revision (Saint Raphael) | Alida | In progress |
| Annual forecast | Alida/OCFO | At risk |
| All files transferred from Alida's drive | Alida → Grant | Required |
| Xero access for successor | Alida/IT | Required |
| Banking access confirmed for Yaseen | Verified | Required |
| Key process documentation | Alida | Required |
| Service provider introductions | Alida | Required |
| **Invoicing rollout - training complete** | Alida + Kyle | Required |
| **Bookkeeper shadowing Alida** | Bookkeeper (if placed) | Target Week 2-4 |

## Risk Summary

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Invoicing stops | Candice backup + OCFO + accelerate invoicing project |
| Payments delayed | Yaseen takes on banking ops |
| Reporting gaps | OCFO provides management accounts |
| Compliance missed | Calendar created, Inaura continues tax work |
| Knowledge loss | Intensive documentation during notice period |

## Success Metrics

## Investment Required

| Item | Estimate | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| OCFO interim support | TBD | 2-4 months |
| Recruitment (permanent hire) | TBD | Agency/direct |
| Internal time (team) | Significant | Transition overhead |
| Potential Inaura uplift | TBD | If scope expands |

## Governance

### Weekly Transition Review
- **Attendees:** Grant, Yaseen, Ricardo, OCFO (when engaged)
- **Frequency:** Weekly during Phase 1 & 2
- **Purpose:** Track progress, resolve blockers, adjust plan

### Escalation Path
- Operational issues → Grant
- Financial approvals → James
- Strategic decisions → Grant + James

## Next Steps (This Week)

### Monday-Tuesday (Immediate)
1. **Meet OCFO candidates** - Grant meeting tomorrow to assess options
2. **Engage accounting-focused agency** - For urgent bookkeeper placement (not Optiworx)
3. **Meet Inaura** - Clarify their role for next 3-6 months, what they need from us
4. **Brief all internal stakeholders** - Each receives their proposed duties

### By End of Week 1
5. **All stakeholders engaged** - Internal and external (Kinari, Ricardo, Inaura)
6. **OCFO/bookkeeper decision made** - Engagement confirmed
7. **Invoicing rollout kickoff** - Begin with Alida training reception/nurses
8. **Access inventory complete** - Document all systems, logins, portals needed

### Alida's Schedule (Ideal)
- Morning sessions: Training/handover with specific stakeholders
- Afternoon sessions: Process documentation, system walkthroughs
- **Minimise BAU work** - Others should absorb where possible so Alida focuses on transfer
