## Decision 1: Engage OCFO

### Context
External support is needed to bridge the gap between Alida's departure and a permanent solution. OCFO (or similar) can provide fractional CFO and bookkeeping services.

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Engage OCFO immediately** | Professional support, quick start, reduces risk | Cost, learning curve |
| **B: Manage internally (Yaseen + Ricardo)** | No cost, existing knowledge | Overloads team, gaps in capability |
| **C: Wait and assess** | See if needed | High risk of failure |

### Recommendation
**Option A: Engage OCFO immediately**

The scope of Alida's role is too broad to absorb internally without significant risk. Professional support provides a safety net.

### Decision Required
- [ ] Confirm engagement with OCFO
- [ ] Agree commercial terms
- [ ] Define start date

**Owner:** Grant
**Decide By:** 28 January 2026

## Decision 2: OCFO Scope of Work

### Context
What specifically should OCFO cover during the transition?

### Recommended Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Bookkeeping (Xero - all 3 orgs) | SARS payment release (James only) |
| Bank reconciliation | Strategic decisions |
| Supplier payment loading | HR matters |
| Payroll data preparation | Clinical operations |
| Monthly management accounts | UK operations (Kinari leads) |
| Weekly KPIs | |
| Cash flow monitoring | |
| Debtors oversight | |
| Compliance calendar tracking | |
| Invoicing (SA) | |
| Process documentation | |
| Invoicing project support | |

### Duration
- Initial: 3 months (Feb - Apr)
- Review: End of March
- Extension: Based on recruitment timeline

### Decision Required
- [ ] Confirm scope as above or modify
- [ ] Agree hours/days per week
- [ ] Confirm reporting line (to Grant)

**Owner:** Grant
**Decide By:** 28 January 2026

## Decision 3: Accelerate Invoicing Transformation Project

### Context
The invoicing transformation project was designed to shift invoicing from a central financial manager to point-of-service (nurses/reception). This directly addresses the risk created by Alida's departure.

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Accelerate - start immediately** | Long-term solution, reduces dependency, already designed | Adds complexity during transition, needs resources |
| **B: Proceed as planned** | Less pressure during transition | Delay to benefits, continued dependency |
| **C: Defer indefinitely** | Focus on immediate transition | Misses opportunity, back to old model |
| **D: Accelerate UK only** | Xero already deployed, less setup | UK is smaller operation |

### Recommendation
**Option A or D: Accelerate the project**

The project was designed for exactly this scenario. Implementation would reduce long-term dependency on a central invoicing person. Consider starting with UK (Option D) as Xero is already deployed there.

### Factors to Consider
- OCFO capacity to lead implementation
- Staff readiness for change
- Timing vs operational stability
- Cost of Xero deployment (if CPT first)

### Decision Required
- [ ] Proceed with project? Yes/No
- [ ] If yes, which location first? CPT/UK
- [ ] Who leads implementation? OCFO/Other
- [ ] Target go-live date

**Owner:** Grant + James
**Decide By:** 14 February 2026

## Decision 4: Begin Recruitment for Permanent Role

### Context
A permanent Financial Manager replacement will be needed. Recruitment takes time.

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Start immediately** | Best chance of Q2 hire | Competes with transition focus |
| **B: Wait until March** | Focus on transition first | Later hire date |
| **C: Use OCFO long-term** | No recruitment needed | Cost, not permanent solution |

### Recommendation
**Option A: Start immediately**

Begin recruitment process now but don't let it distract from handover. Target:
- Define role: Week 2
- Post/engage agency: Week 3-4
- Interviews: March-April
- Hire: April-May
- Start: May

### Decision Required
- [ ] Confirm recruitment approach (agency vs direct)
- [ ] Define role requirements
- [ ] Set salary range
- [ ] Assign recruitment lead

**Owner:** Grant
**Decide By:** 7 February 2026

## Decision 5: Inaura Expanded Role

### Context
Inaura currently handles payroll, PAYE, VAT, and financial statements. Could they take on more (e.g., bookkeeping, supplier payments)?

### Current Assessment
- Service quality described as "questionable"
- Already embedded in SA operations
- Cost-effective if capable

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Expand Inaura scope** | Existing relationship, potentially cheaper | Quality concerns, risk |
| **B: Keep current scope** | Known quantity | Still need other support |
| **C: Reduce Inaura, OCFO takes more** | Higher quality | Higher cost |

### Recommendation
**Option B initially, reassess**

Keep Inaura at current scope initially. Observe their performance during transition. If they "step up" as suggested they might, consider expansion. If not, maintain or reduce.

### Decision Required
- [ ] Communicate expectations to Inaura
- [ ] Set review point (end of March)
- [ ] Define criteria for expansion

**Owner:** Grant
**Decide By:** 28 February 2026 (after initial assessment)

## Decision 6: Additional Banking Signatory

### Context
Currently only James has Level 4 access for SARS payments. This creates a single point of failure.

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Add another Level 4 (Grant or Ricardo)** | Backup for James, business continuity | Significant trust decision, process to add |
| **B: Maintain status quo** | No change needed | Risk remains if James unavailable |

### Recommendation
**Option A: Consider adding Grant as Level 4**

This is a strategic decision about business continuity. Not urgent but worth considering.

### Decision Required
- [ ] Is additional Level 4 signatory needed?
- [ ] If yes, who?
- [ ] Timeline to implement

**Owner:** James
**Decide By:** 28 February 2026

## Decision 7: Invoicing Project - Location First

### Context
If proceeding with invoicing transformation, which location goes first?

### Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Cape Town first (as originally planned)** | Fresh Xero deployment, clean start, lessons for UK | More setup work, Xero deployment needed |
| **B: UK first** | Xero already deployed, less setup | UK is smaller, lessons may not fully apply |

### Recommendation
**Consider Option B: UK first**

Given the transition pressure, starting where Xero is already deployed reduces complexity. UK is smaller but provides proof of concept before larger CPT rollout.

### Decision Required
- [ ] Confirm which location first
- [ ] Confirm Xero deployment timeline (if CPT)
- [ ] Confirm training schedule

**Owner:** Grant
**Decide By:** 14 March 2026
