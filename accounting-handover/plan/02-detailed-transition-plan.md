# Detailed Transition Plan

## Phase Overview

**Critical:** Phases 1 and 2 run concurrently during the notice period. Operational handover begins Week 2, not after Alida leaves.

| Phase | Period | Focus | Key Outcome |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1+2: Handover & Operate** | 26 Jan - 23 Feb | Concurrent documentation AND operational handover, invoicing rollout | Team operating independently before Alida leaves |
| **Phase 3: Transform** | 24 Feb onwards | Stabilise, permanent hire, complete invoicing rollout | New steady state |

### Concurrent Approach (Weeks 2-4)

```
Week 2-4: RUNNING IN PARALLEL
├── Documentation & Knowledge Transfer (continues)
├── Operational Shadowing (LIVE - not waiting until Alida leaves)
├── Invoicing Rollout (training nurses, reception)
└── Bookkeeper Onboarding (if placed - overlaps with Alida)
```

---

## Phase 1: Handover (26 Jan - 23 Feb 2026)

**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Primary Goal:** Capture all knowledge, complete critical tasks, prepare for transition

### 1.1 Immediate Actions (Week 1: 26 Jan - 1 Feb)

**Goal:** All stakeholders engaged with proposed duties by end of week. Invoicing rollout begins.

**Note:** OCFO is a consultancy - can provide fractional CFO, bookkeeper, or both. Prioritise getting a bookkeeper who can overlap with Alida for 1-2 weeks. Use accounting-focused agency, not Optiworx.
