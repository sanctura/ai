### Transition Approach (Phases 1+2 Run Concurrently)

| Phase | Period | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 1+2: Handover & Operate** | 26 Jan - 23 Feb | Documentation AND operational handover run together |

| Begin invoicing rollout | Grant + Alida | Week 1 |
| All stakeholders briefed with duties | Grant | 31 Jan |

### Role Allocation Summary

|--------|----------------|
| Grant | Transition lead |
| Yaseen | Banking operations backup |
| Ricardo | Financial oversight |
| Kyle | SA practice coordination, **invoicing rollout lead (CPT)** |
