| SA invoicing (Xero) | Alida | OCFO | OCFO |
| UK invoicing | Alida | Kinari | Kinari |
| SA supplier payments - load | Alida | Yaseen | OCFO |
| SA supplier payments - release | Alida/Yaseen | Yaseen | - |

### Capacity Assessment

| Person | Current Load | Available Capacity | Best Suited For |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| James | High (CEO + Clinical) | Very Limited | SARS releases, approvals |
| Grant | High (MD transition) | Limited | Oversight, decisions, relationships |
| Yaseen | High (CPO) | Limited | Payment operations, banking |
| Kyle | Medium-High | Some | Practice-level invoicing, local coordination |
| Amanda | Medium-High | Some | UK practice operations |
| Ricardo | Variable | Moderate | Financial oversight, reporting review |
| Candice | ? | Some | Healthbridge invoicing support |

---

## Recommended Role Allocation (Transition Period)

### Internal Team

| Person | Additional Responsibilities |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Yaseen** | Primary banking operations (loading, non-SARS releases), cash flow alerts |
| **Ricardo** | Financial reporting review, liaison with OCFO, Alida knowledge capture |
| **Kyle** | SA practice-level coordination, invoicing rollout lead (SA) |
| **Amanda** | UK coordination with Kinari, invoicing rollout lead (UK) |
| **Grant** | Overall transition oversight, OCFO management, strategic decisions |
| **James** | SARS payment releases, major approvals (minimise additional load) |

### Payment Controls (During Transition)

**Dual control must be maintained:**
- **Bookkeeper/OCFO:** Loads payments (no release authority)
- **Grant or Yaseen:** Releases payments (segregation from loader)
- **James:** SARS payments only (VAT, Income Tax)

This ensures no single person controls the full payment process. Even during transition with new/interim staff, controls remain in place.

### External Support

| Provider | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **OCFO** | Bookkeeping, management accounts, cash flow monitoring, process documentation, invoicing project support |
| **Inaura** | Continue current scope; assess for expansion if quality improves |
| **Kinari** | Continue current scope; potential slight expansion for UK |
