### Capacity Assessment

| Person | Current Load | Available Capacity | Best Suited For |

| Kyle | Medium-High | Some | Practice-level invoicing, local coordination |
| Amanda | Medium-High | Some | UK practice operations |
| Ricardo | Variable | Moderate | Financial oversight, reporting review |

---

## Recommended Role Allocation (Transition Period)

### Internal Team

| Person | Additional Responsibilities |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Yaseen** | Primary banking operations (loading, non-SARS releases), cash flow alerts |
| **Ricardo** | Financial reporting review, liaison with OCFO, Alida knowledge capture |
| **Kyle** | SA invoicing governance (not execution), debtor disputes (SA), stock count |
| **Amanda** | UK invoicing governance (not execution), debtor disputes (UK), Kinari coordination |
| **Grant** | Overall transition oversight, OCFO management, strategic decisions |
| **James** | SARS payment releases, major approvals (minimise additional load) |

### Payment Controls (During Transition)

**Ronald has no banking access. Payment workflow:**
1. **Ronald:** Prepares payment schedules (reconciles invoices, prepares details)
2. **Grant:** Loads payments into Investec (interim arrangement until better access solution found)
3. **Grant or Yaseen:** Releases non-SARS payments
4. **James:** Releases SARS payments only (VAT, Income Tax) - no delegation possible

This ensures no single person controls the full payment process. The access limitation on Ronald adds an extra step but maintains segregation of duties.

### External Support

| Provider | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **Ronald / Clearshell** | Fractional CFO: bookkeeping, management accounts (by 7th working day), cash flow, compliance calendar, invoicing audit, process documentation, Bokelman transition |
| **Inaura** | Continue current scope during transition; planned phase-out to Bokelman or equivalent |
| **Kinari / Capricorn Capital Services** | Continue current UK scope; receives payroll data from Ronald |
