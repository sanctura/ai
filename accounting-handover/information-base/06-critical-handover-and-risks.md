# Critical Handover Items and Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

Alida's departure creates significant operational risk across 7 entities in two jurisdictions. The 4-week notice period is short given the breadth of responsibilities. Key risks centre on knowledge concentration, timing (February forecast period), and banking control dependencies.

## Critical Handover Items

### Priority 1: Immediate Operational Continuity

#### Invoicing Operations
| Item | Entity | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Patient invoicing (Healthbridge) | Inc | HIGH | Candice has some experience - training needed |
| Patient invoicing (Xero) | Sanctura Ltd | MEDIUM | Xero standard process |
| Inter-company invoicing | Saint Raphael | MEDIUM | Xero standard process |
| Quoting | Inc, Sanctura | MEDIUM | Xero standard process |

**Mitigation:** Prioritise Healthbridge training; Candice may bridge gap

**Strategic Option:** The [Invoicing Transformation Project](07-invoicing-transformation-project.md) was designed to shift invoicing from central finance to point-of-service (nurses/reception). If accelerated, this could fundamentally reduce invoicing dependency risk. Key decision: accelerate project as part of transition response?

#### Supplier Payments
| Item | Entity | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Payment loading | All SA entities | HIGH | Banking access required |
| Payment release | All SA entities | MEDIUM | Yaseen can release non-SARS |
| Reconciliation | All entities | MEDIUM | Process documentation needed |
| UK payments | Sanctura Ltd | MEDIUM | Kinari can support |

**Mitigation:** Ensure Yaseen aware of increased role; document processes

#### Payroll
| Item | Entity | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Data provision to Inaura | Saint Raphael | HIGH | Staff files with Alida |
| Review before submission | Saint Raphael | MEDIUM | Quality control step |
| UK payroll data | Sanctura Ltd | LOW | Kinari/Lauren handle |

**Mitigation:** Transfer staff files; document data requirements for Inaura

|------|------------|----------|-------|
| Annual Forecast | HIGH | February | Must complete or hand over template/method |
| Weekly KPIs | MEDIUM | Ongoing | Document sources and calculations |
| Monthly Management Accounts | HIGH | Ongoing | Document report structure |

**Mitigation:** Alida to complete forecast if possible; document methodology

---

### Priority 3: Banking and Cash Flow

| Item | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Balance monitoring | HIGH | Critical for payment timing |
| Cash flow forecasting | HIGH | Linked to forecast work |
| SARS payment reminders to James | MEDIUM | James must be prompted |
| UK bank monitoring | MEDIUM | Kinari can assist |

**Mitigation:** Document thresholds and monitoring frequency

---

### Priority 4: Compliance

|------|------------|----------|-------|

| La Porta Industries Returns | LOW | In progress | Being completed |
| February stock count | HIGH | End Feb | Must be coordinated |
| Workman's Comp | MEDIUM | June | Calendar item |

**Mitigation:** Complete in-progress items; calendar all future dates

### Priority 5: Relationships and Access

| Item | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|

| Insurance broker relationships | LOW | Introduce successor |
| Trust relationship (Atlantic) | MEDIUM | Jess introduction planned |
| Optiworx relationship | MEDIUM | Files need transfer |
| Service provider relationships | LOW | Formal introductions needed |

## Dependency Analysis

### Single Point of Failure: James

| Function | Dependency | Risk |
|----------|------------|------|
| SARS payment release | Only James at Level 4 | If unavailable, payments delayed |
| Major decisions | CEO approval | Normal business |

**Consideration:** Adding another Level 4 signatory would be a strategic decision

### Single Point of Failure: Alida (Current)

| Function | Impact of Departure |
|----------|---------------------|
| SA invoicing | High - Candice partial backup |
| SA supplier payments | High - Yaseen can release |
| Payroll data | High - files with Alida |
| Management accounts | High - no documented backup |
| Compliance tracking | High - no documented calendar |
| Debtors management | Medium - process not documented |

## Transition Options Analysis

### Option 1: Internal Transition (Yaseen + Candice)

**Pros:**
- Existing knowledge of business
- Banking access exists (Yaseen)
- Some invoicing experience (Candice)
- Lower cost

**Cons:**
- Significant additional workload
- Training required
- May lack capacity for full scope
- No financial reporting experience identified

**Suitable For:** Short-term bridging

### Option 2: OCFO Consultancy Support

**Pros:**
- Professional financial management
- Can start quickly
- Brings external expertise
- Scalable support

**Cons:**
- Cost
- Learning curve on business specifics
- May need long-term solution anyway

**Suitable For:** Interim management, process establishment

### Option 3: Hire Replacement

**Pros:**
- Long-term solution
- Dedicated resource
- Full ownership

**Cons:**
- Time to recruit (typically 4-8 weeks minimum)
- Onboarding time
- May not find equivalent experience

**Suitable For:** Permanent solution (start recruitment immediately)

### Option 4: Accelerate Invoicing Transformation Project

**Pros:**
- Designed to eliminate central invoicing dependency
- Shifts invoicing to nurses/reception at point of service
- Changes bookkeeper role to audit/oversight
- Long-term sustainable solution

**Cons:**
- All phases still pending
- Requires Xero deployment (Cape Town) or workflow changes (UK)
- Training required for nurses and reception
- Alida was planned project lead

**Suitable For:** Medium-term structural solution (can run parallel to Option 2/3)

See [07-invoicing-transformation-project.md](07-invoicing-transformation-project.md) for full details.
