## Recommended Actions

2. Document exact dates for each compliance item
3. Set up calendar reminders/notifications
4. Identify who will own each task post-departure

### During Notice Period
1. Complete all in-progress submissions (La Porta Industries)
2. Prepare for February forecast
3. Execute February stock count
4. Review insurance policies coming up for renewal

### Post-Departure Setup
1. Implement compliance calendar in shared system
2. Assign ownership for each recurring task
3. Build in lead-time reminders (e.g., 2 weeks before due)
4. Establish review process for compliance tracking
