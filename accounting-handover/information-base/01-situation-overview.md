6. **Timing** - Departure coincides with forecast preparation period

## Strategic Context: Invoicing Transformation Project

A project was already in planning to fundamentally change the invoicing model. See [07-invoicing-transformation-project.md](07-invoicing-transformation-project.md) for full details.

### Summary

| Current State | Future State |
|--------------|--------------|
| Alida invoices retrospectively | Staff invoice at point of service |
| Central dependency | Distributed to nurses/reception |
| Bookkeeper creates invoices | Bookkeeper audits invoices |
| Payment chasing required | Payment on the day (default) |

### Transition Relevance

- **Opportunity:** This project directly addresses the invoicing dependency risk
- **Challenge:** All phases are pending; Alida was to lead implementation
- **Decision Required:** Accelerate, pause, or modify this project as part of transition response
