## Banking Systems and Controls

### South Africa - Investec Online Banking

**Entities:** James La Porta Inc, Saint Raphael

#### User Access Levels

| User | Level | Capabilities |
|------|-------|--------------|
| James | Level 4 | Full authority, release all including SARS |
| Alida | Lower | Load payments, view accounts, release non-SARS |
| Yaseen | Same as Alida | Load payments, view accounts, release non-SARS |

#### Dual Control System
- **Principle:** Two people required for every transaction
- **Load:** One person creates the payment
- **Release:** Different person authorises
- **Example:** If Yaseen loads, Alida can release (or vice versa)
- **SARS Exception:** Only James can release VAT and Income Tax payments

#### Critical Note
- Level 4 access is required to close accounts
- Adding another Level 4 user would be a significant decision
